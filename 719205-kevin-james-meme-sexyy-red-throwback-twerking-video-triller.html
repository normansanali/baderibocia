While many are using a throwback photo of the comedian from King of Queens in which he gives a knowing smirk to the camera to crack jokes, others have been putting their Photoshop skills to the test. One creator opted to add large breasts to James' frame to enhance the photo's reliability. Others have taken things even further, photoshopping on the faces of stars like <a href=# class=text-word rel>Sexyy Red</a> and <a href=# class=text-word rel>T-Pain</a>.</p><p>When the Hood Hottest Princess came across an image of her head and famous chain edited onto the Paul Blart: Mall Cop actor's body (breasts included), she didn't know what to think. "Now [what the f**k] is this üíÄ," Sexyy asked on Twitter.

Earlier this month, one of them revealed their <a href=# rel>out-of-this-world drawing</a> of the rap diva, and she wasn't exactly flattered, to put it mildly. Thankfully, she has a great sense of humour that allows her to laugh messy situations off.</p><p>Elsewhere online, Red's loyal listeners have done their due diligence in digging up her past content. Earlier this week, a throwback video of her getting ready in her room and twerking for Triller popped up. "How y'all be finding everything üíÄ?" she couldn't help but inquire.</p><p><strong>Read More:</strong> <strong><a href=# rel>Charleston White Accuses Sexyy Red Of Having An STD</a></strong></p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-fans-find-old-video-from-big-sexyy-s-triller-days>Fans Find Old Video From Big Sexyy's Triller Days</h2></span><p>Has Sexyy Red stayed true to her roots throughout her legendary come-up?
