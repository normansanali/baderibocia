Eastwood has directed 40 films, most notably The Outlaw Josey Wales (1976), Gran Torino (2008), Million Dollar Baby (2004), and Unforgiven (1992) – with Eastwood taking home both the Academy Awards for Best Picture and Best Director for the latter two.</p><p data-characters=319 data-current-count=319 data-injectable=false>If all things must come to an end, Clint Eastwood’s seemingly immortal life and career must also, and the star <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">has been asked about retirement for the last 20 or 30 years</a>. Recently, Eastwood has been speculated to have made formal plans to bow out for good after the release of what is said to be his final film.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-what-is-clint-eastwood-s-last-movie data-injectable=false>What is Clint Eastwood’s last movie?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/Gran-Torino.jpg><p data-characters=422 data-current-count=422 data-injectable=true>According to an exclusive report by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">DiscussingFilm</a> from March 2023, the upcoming movie Juror No. 2 will be Clint Eastwood’s final film. According to the film website, the legal drama is “being internally billed” as Eastwood’s last as director. While this report has not been confirmed by anyone in Eastwood’s camp, it seems highly possible, as the actor and filmmaker nears his mid-nineties.</p><p data-characters=431 data-current-count=431 data-injectable=true>Juror No. 2 was formally announced by <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Hollywood Reporter</a> in April 2023, with Nicholas Hoult and Toni Collette attached to star. The outlet stated that the film “take[s] place during&nbsp;a murder trial and follows a juror, to be played by Hoult, who realizes that he may have caused the victim’s death. He must decide whether to manipulate the jury to save himself, or reveal the truth and turn himself in.”&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=499 data-current-count=499 data-injectable=false>Filming for Juror No. 2 has not taken place yet, as <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">production was interrupted</a> by the Writers Guild of America (WGA) and Screen Actors Guild (SAG) strikes that began this summer, with the latter still ongoing as of October 2023. For now, Eastwood is still attached to direct the film, written by Jonathan Abrams. Eastwood’s last film as director and lead actor was Cry Macho, a 2021 western movie, which was released in theaters and on streaming on Max (then known as HBO Max) simultaneously.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeemsS0e8eaqmabnJ67tXnEmqqtr5%2BksW6%2BxK2gq52UYrWqv4ylmKysXaK8t7XEZpyxqJyWtq%2Bxw2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
