The comments section of her post was flooded with well wishes from fans, who sent their love amidst this difficult time. On May 1, JoJo posted another sweet photo of O2 on her <a href=# rel=nofollow data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Instagram</a> Story, which she captioned, ‚ÄúMissin this face a lot today. It‚Äôs settling in that it‚Äôs real and it‚Äôs sooo hard. He was just a baby.‚Äù She also included sobbing face emojis and a broken heart emoji with her message.</p><p id=content-paragraph-8>The former reality star had something to get excited about following this tragedy, though, as her merch for PRIDE also dropped on May 1. JoJo came out in January 2021 and has been an advocate for the LGBTQ+ community ever since. She created the Pride collection herself and dropped it one month before the month of Pride in June.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWpjZH12e49qZqOnmqR6tLXWmmSdp5disaatw2aYnJuZmbKvwIyvoJ2dn2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
