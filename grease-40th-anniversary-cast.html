When Grease, the movie based on the hit Broadway musical, made its big screen debut in 1978, it was the highest grossing film of the year.

He went on to earn a number of Oscar, Golden Globe, BAFTA and SAG nominations over the years for his roles in instant classics like Pulp Fiction, Get Shorty and Hairspray.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For his most recent project, the now 64-year-old Travolta stars as legendary Gambino crime family boss John Gotti in the mobster biopic Gotti—in theaters June 15.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">Olivia Newton-John</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/06/olivia-newton-john-then-now-grease-copy.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At 29, Olivia Newton-John wasn’t sure if she could pass as the high school-aged Sandy Olsson. But it was clear to John Travolta that she was the one that he wanted.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“She had a brilliant voice, and I didn’t think there could be any more correct person for Sandy in the universe,” he told <a href=# rel=noopener>Vanity Fair</a> in 2016. Travolta was determined to get her the part. “I insisted that she be met and that we cast her.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Primarily a singer, Newton-John has since described Grease as a <a href=# rel=noopener>“turning point”</a> for her musical career, allowing her to transition from exclusively country songs to pop hits like “Physical.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Newton-John has won several American Music Awards and four Grammys and is considered one of the world’s best-selling artists of all time.
