That makes them particularly dangerous if your fortress is not prepared to handle them because all it takes is a single bite to spread their curse, which can then run rampant until you have no dwarves left.</p><p>Werebeasts in Dwarf Fortress come in all shapes and sizes (though they are almost always larger than standard dwarves).

That’s when you want to set up an early warning system to detect a stealthed werebeast. For instance, you can chain dogs at a perimeter or inside the tunnels. Or use outside cattle farms to sacrifice and buy time.</p><p>After they’re discovered, you need to have a way of sealing your fort and getting your dwarves inside until the full moon passes (several in-game days). Normal doors won’t be an obstacle for a werebeast, so it’s best to use drawbridges with pulleys to seal your fort. After the full moon passes, the beast will revert back to a naked humanoid and flee the map.</p><h3>About the author</h3><img alt src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/secure.gravatar.com/avatar/269d3281d3b1d5ed371e578150f55b3a?s=192&d=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.gamepur.com%2Fwp-content%2Fuploads%2F2020%2F01%2Fcropped-gamepur_favicon-1-192x192.png&r=g2x" height=96 width=96 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><h3>Miljan Truc</h3><p class=author-url></p><p class=author-desc>I have been into gaming since the days of Sega Mega Drive and Amiga. Over the years in gaming, I have raided at a high level, completed rare achievements, coached other players, and written about games since 2016. Whether it’s been clicking heads; developing cities, colonies, and empires; or commanding parties of adventurers; I’ve always prided myself on being able to understand the underlying mechanics of games.
