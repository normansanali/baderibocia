But that doesn’t mean Esme will be fortunate enough to pull Spencer away from his lady love.</p><h2>General Hospital Spoilers — Bon Voyage</h2><p>Esme’s departure from Port Charles was anything but uneventful. As Dante Falconeri (Dominic Zamprogna) and Harrison Chase (Josh Swickard) work to chase her down across the ocean, it’s going to be a race against time to catch up with Spencer and Trina, let alone a criminal hiding in the wings.</p><p>As Laura Collins (Genie Francis) and her team of heroes attempt to track Esme down before she can reach Spencer and Trina, they will struggle to make sense of what exactly she’s gunning for in chasing them down — and that could backfire on all of them.<br>GH Spoilers Claim Drama Ensues</p><p><img alt="General Hospital: Spencer Cassadine (Nicholas Alexander Chavez) and Trina Robinson (Tabyana Ali)" width=730 height=487 data-jpibfi-post-excerpt data-jpibfi-post-url=https://celebbabylaundry.com/2024/01/general-hospital-spoilers-spencer-and-trina-are-in-paris-but-only-one-of-them-is-staying/ data-jpibfi-post-title="General Hospital Spoilers: Spencer And Trina Are In Paris — But Only One Of Them Is Staying" data-jpibfi-src sizes="(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebbabylaundry.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/01/GH-Spencer-and-Trina.jpg></p><p>Esme is sick and tired of everyone assuming the worst about her. So what if she’s guilty of everything they accused her of in the past, right? <a href=#>She has tried hard to turn over a new lea</a>f, and it’s been more difficult to maintain that reputation and mindset ever since she got her memories back.</p><p>Recalling the way she felt so jilted by Spencer has left her teetering on the fence, wanting to be a better person but also wanting to feel the satisfaction of revenge. When Spencer and Trina realize she’s in Paris, we can expect Spencer will stop at nothing to protect the young woman he loves.</p><h3>General Hospital Spoilers — Bon Voyage, Again</h3><p><a href=#>Rumor has it this trip isn’t going to end in Paris</a>. Trina may not have the stomach to stay in town and study abroad in the wake of Spencer’s absence.</p><p>That’s right. Her beau isn’t going to be heading home with her, and he won’t be shacking up with her in Paris either. While we still don’t know where he’s headed, we can rest assured that someone else will arrange for him to disappear.</p><p>The question is: Will it be Esme who orchestrates his absence, or Nikolas Cassadine (Adam Huss)? <a href=# rel=noopener>Stay tuned for more GH news and spoilers to find out.</a></p><p></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiblaGyo67Am7ClmaWjsbPFjZympmdiZX91e49qZqCdnpq%2ForiMoaasqJmprq150qmmoqSVp8Buv8%2BepZydomKur7CMramippFirrOxjKKlZqiRp7a0ecGuq2annqHGbrvNnmSonl2ptaa5jKKqZquklsaqusZo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
