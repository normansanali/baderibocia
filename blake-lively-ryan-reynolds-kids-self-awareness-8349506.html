It’s just totally different now. People are much more self-aware. And that’s the thing we sort of hang our hat on the most is self-awareness with our kids. Not be happy, not be anything, just be self-aware and welcome everything in.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Earlier this year, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Lively</a> also spoke about parenting with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Forbes</a>, saying that raising her kids has made her feel most like herself (talk about some self-awareness).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I think having children for me made me feel so much more in my skin," she said at the time. "I never felt more myself or at ease in my own body or more confident — not to say that there aren't a bevy of insecurities coming at me a million times a day, but I just feel incredibly settled."<br></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57waWYpJ1doba3scuyZKuxkaN6s7HYp6alnKNiuKqw0maqnqSWYq64rdGepZ6ro2KFdICYbmdv</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
