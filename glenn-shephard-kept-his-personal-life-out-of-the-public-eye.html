With his laid-back demeanor and an Instagram full of exotic photographs from his trips, he has been the talk of the town since then. His celebrity has also sparked interest in his personal life. And the captain isn’t bashful about his dating adventures, either — he simply cares about what he wants to partake in and expose. He has yet to marry or have children. But he has his sights set on a certain lady.</p><h2>Glenn Shephard’s Love Life</h2><p>Shephard has not disclosed all of his previous relationships. Nonetheless, as someone who has spent most of his life on boats and on the sea, the majority of his love experiences have occurred on a boat. On March 15, 2022, he announced one such connection to supporters through text message. He was asked whether he had ever dated a crew member or a charter visitor during a Q&A session.</p><p>Glenn Shephard, who is still single, has his eyes set on a mystery lady and a Bravo TV Housewife. In response, he acknowledged dating a chief cook on a boat he used to command before the Parsifal III, but he did not elaborate. He is still quite involved with women. “I’m not married, but I’m not celibate,” he informed Andy Cohen at the season two reunion when the presenter questioned whether he was single.<br>The captain’s Instagram DMs were inundated with suitors. When Cohen questioned him on it, he said, “Oh, absolutely. I receive a lot of fascinating direct messages. Photos, videos, and several invites are available. It’s fantastic. “I adore it.”</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Glenn-Shephard-2.jpg alt="Glenn Shephard" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Despite these approaches, Shephard is only interested in one lady. He told this to Bravo TV just before the third season started in February 2022.</p><p>“There’s this one woman I’m interested in,” he said. “There’s a certain lady I’m interested in.”</p><p>He couldn’t talk about it in public since she didn’t want to become a public personality overnight. Shephard knows since he, too, is someone who likes to keep things within limits.</p><h2>Why Glenn Shephard May Not Be Married</h2><p>While it’s absolutely reasonable to guess that Shephard isn’t married because he hasn’t met “the one,” the underlying reason for his single status maybe his work. And his strict professionalism.&nbsp;On Below Deck Sailing Yacht, the skipper has acknowledged the challenge of sustaining a relationship while sailing so frequently. He also makes an effort not to violate certain professional boundaries at work. Throughout the seasons, he has had several opportunities to meet with charter passengers.</p><p>During the Q&A, he remembered other situations when he had the opportunity to meet up with visitors. But he restricted all of those opportunities to platonic partnerships.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/05/Glenn-Shephard-3.jpg alt="Glenn Shephard" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>“In some scenarios, the personnel is not supposed to fraternize with the visitors,” he said. Even during charters, if visitors encourage the yachties to mingle, they are expected to “be discreet and not accept any advances since that’s not really intended to happen.”</p><p>Although visitors and crew members are not permitted, coworkers from the same network are. And Shephard has already investigated several Bravo TV ladies. Cohen indicated his wish to pair Shephard up with one of the ladies during one of his appearances on Watch What Happens Live in February 2022, even presenting the captain with the names of Eboni K. Williams and Heather Gay.&nbsp;He answered by adding that Williams’ name jumped out to him and that he had requested Cohen to “set him up” with her. Nothing is available on that front… yet.</p><span class=tag-title>Related tags :</span> <span class="tags-links clearfix"><a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Below Deck Sailing Yacht</a> <a href=# rel=tag data-wpel-link=internal>Glenn Shephard</a></span><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiepZ2eo3q0tMSpn5qqlGK4przTZp%2Biq12lsrO%2FzqeYpWWcnrOmec6uq2anlmLBqbGMqaybpJmYeqbFxGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
