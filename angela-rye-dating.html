After disclosing her September breakup with Common, she said:</p><p>“We just want different things, I had told him about it the day before. As I’m leaning toward I want kids and he’s leaning toward “I don’t know” we’ve been discussing the possibility of starting a family for the past two months. When someone says “I don’t know” I suppose it’s because they don’t want to hurt you”.</p><p>Rye continued:</p><p>“I think it was an impeccable parting of ways. We’re very clear about the fact that we were not aligned in those interests. We will always be friends. He’s a really good person.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Follow us on Twitter</a> to keep up with the newest celebrity news, including marriage, divorce, breakups and more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpbGdgaXxyfI6apaCdnJZ6s8XEZpuarJmjtHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
