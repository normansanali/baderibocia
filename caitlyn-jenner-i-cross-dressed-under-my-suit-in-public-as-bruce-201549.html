I was very stealthy. I was good at this stuff. I would literally go back to the hotel room, cross dress, walk out around the hotel, and they never knew.”</p><p>Jenner explained that because nobody expected Bruce to be dressed as a woman, she “never had a problem” with anyone recognizing her.</p><p>When DeGeneres asked the former Olympian whether she had ever thought about coming out earlier in life, Jenner said that the timing was never right.&nbsp;</p><p>“Back in the ‘80s, I went through a really difficult time,” she said. “I lived by myself for maybe six years up in the mountains, up in Malibu. I never really left the house besides just to go to work. I was on hormones, [and] I thought for sure I would transition before I was 40 years of age, and I got to 39 and just couldn’t do it. I couldn’t go any farther.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>It wasn’t until more recently that she felt comfortable going forward with transitioning, she explained, adding that her experience with her reality show, I Am Cait, has helped her to recognize what a difference she can make in the lives of others.&nbsp;</p><p>“There’s nothing better than waking up in the morning and getting to be your authentic self,” she said.</p><p>Tune into The Ellen DeGeneres Show on Tuesday, Sept. 8, to see what else Jenner had to say about her experience coming out so publicly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGacmZmpubq6jKOcp6aVp3qqecKrpqyrXZm%2Fpr%2FSnptmrZ6ZsrN5zLJkrK2ZqXqquoyprJukmZh6or%2BMm6mum5Vif3F9lG1waA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
