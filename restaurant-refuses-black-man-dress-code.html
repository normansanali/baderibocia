Source: Instagram/@tr0n_almightyThe internet is proof that Karens come a dime a dozen. Whether it’s at a park, sauna, or even your own home, there’s sure to be a middle-class white woman who wants it her way. But today, we’re giving the Karens a break; Instead, we’d like to talk about the Kyles of the world — one of which went viral in a video posted by a social media user by the name of @tr0n_almighty."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

He got more than he expected when he showed up at The Parliament for a night out.</p><p>“We gotta use our platform to stop allowing these people to racially profile black people and allow them to get away with it,” Tron said in the caption of the now-viral <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a> post, adding that he sensed trouble from Kyle (we don’t know his real name) before he even arrived at the door.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Instagram/@tr0n_almighty</a></figure><p>When Kyle told Tron that his outfit didn’t adhere to the establishment’s dress code policy, Tron pointed out multiple examples of white patrons wearing almost the same thing.</p><p>"I asked to see his dress code or where I could find it online and he started mumbling,” he shared. “Parliament Dallas is owned by a racist and shouldn’t be supported by any person of color ever again.”</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=#>Comment</a><br>by <a href=#>u/silentsole87</a> from discussion <a href=#>This restaurant refused to seat a black customer for wearing an informal attire, while the other seated white patrons were wearing informal attire but still given a table.</a><br>in <a href=#>PublicFreakout</a></figure><p>Looking back on the bar’s reviews, this isn’t the first time the spot has been accused of racism.</p><p>Months before the incident went viral, another patron echoed Tron’s sentiments in a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">review</a>: “Got turned away wearing shorts, which is weird since I’ve worn shorts before, but things may have changed, it be like that.”</p><p>“A bit later a white guy was let in wearing shorts, but even later an Indian guy was turned away because of shorts,” the reviewer added. "Definitely weird, but maybe just one of those days. Will wear pants next time and some skin-whitening cream.”</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Source: Reddit</a></figure><p>Since the video surfaced on social media, negative reviews have continued to roll in on Yelp and Google. Additionally, users on Reddit have chimed in on the diversity controversy. Although they didn’t identify him by name, @<a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">PompousClock</a> said that they recognized the bouncer in the video.</p><p>“Holy s---, I recognize the guy in the blue collared shirt,” the Redditor wrote. “Just looked up the dress code. There is no mention that athletic shoes or shorts are prohibited. ‘Athletic wear’ is prohibited, but only if it is worn in conjunction with another prohibited item. Shorts are not on that list.”</p><p>Now that The Parliament has gone viral for its antics, it’s safe to say that this allegedly racist restaurant is cooked.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfp7K0wMCuqZqmpGK%2FprLUrJysZZKhrqS3jKaYp2WUp7K0v4ycpp2d</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
