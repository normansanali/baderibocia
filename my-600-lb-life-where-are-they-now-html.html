Back then, he weighed in at 687.5 lbs and revealed he had gained nearly 400 lbs in the previous four years. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-635 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>A recent video uploaded by TLC titled 'Justin's Incredible Weight-Loss! | My 600 lb Life: Where Are They Now?'&nbsp;gave a deeper look at his life.</p><p>McSwain had gotten so big that he struggled to even walk around. His weight had inconvenienced him and he admitted it prevented him from doing normal things.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>He was determined to get back to normal weight, and his transformation was well documented in the series. Before he began working on himself, <a href=# rel=follow>Dr. Now</a> gave him a mission — to lose 100 lbs in two months. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-615 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longer_content"></span><p>If he was successful in doing so, the doctor promised to approve him for weight loss surgery.</p><p>McSwain started exercising and following the recommended diet strictly. When he went back to Dr. Now two months later, he weighed in at 595 pounds. Though McSwain only lost 92.5 pounds, a little short of the target, the doctor approved his weight loss surgery.</p><p>McSwain continued with his&nbsp;active lifestyle and healthier diet. Aside from physical exercise and food, he also saw a therapist regularly for over a year to figure out and deal with his overeating. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-616 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-longest_content"></span><p>Over the course of his time on the show, the TLC star lost an impressive 450 pounds. He also attended several events where he shared his story, hoping to inspire and help other people going through similar problems.</p><p>During his transformation journey, McSwain’s relationship with his father grew stronger as he had moved to Houston to be with his son during the entire ordeal.&nbsp;</p><h2>‘My 600-lbs Life’ Unsuccessful Stories</h2><p>While McSwain and many others like Anjie J are the successful patients of the TLC reality series, there have also been unsuccessful patients such as the <a href=# rel=follow>Assanti brothers</a> and Henry Foots. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-617 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_first_paragraph"></span><p>The Assanti brothers <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">quit</a> the program with no success while Henry Foots <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">passed away</a> a few months after going through a surgical procedure.</p><p>Many others whose story was documented in My 600-Lb&nbsp;Life also had major complications after their time on&nbsp;the show, with several people’s relationship failing and many others putting the weight back on after surgery.</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-long_content"></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-incontent_6"></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJummaOge6S7zGinqKhdmMKtwNSrnGilqWKDcXyMpZlmpJmbsm7Dx56pnmWRp7JuwMeesGamn6x7qcDMpQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
