The show is back for a new season with a new group of people and Tasia is one of the contestants gracing your TV set.</p><p>The well-liked Netflix series has a brand-new cast for season 5. Cast members who are confined to their own apartments for the next season’s launch on December 28, 2022. They communicate with one another through online chats, and they choose the best and worst players each week by popular vote. In Season 5, the same format is maintained, but there is a new cast of contestants.</p><p>What is her job? Who are her parents? Where is she from? Find answers to these questions as you keep scrolling down.</p><h3><strong>Tasia Lesley aka Tamira On The Circle Season 5</strong></h3><p>One of the cast members in the 5th season of The Circle is Tasia Lesley as Tamira. She has also posted skits about signing up for the show for Tiktok. The stake is high, so catch up to the show to see if she will win the prize pool of $100,000. This season is all about singles, or at least claims that they are, so we can expect some romance this season, although this is not a dating show.</p><p>This year’s other contestants are Brett Robinson, Chaz Lawery, <a href=#>Oliver Twixt</a>, Sam Carmona, Tom Houghton, and Xanthi Perdikomatis who are playing as themselves. Meanwhile, contestants playing as catfish are Brian Clark as his daughter Brittney, Billie-Jean Blackett AKA (Bruno, her ex), Raven Sutton and Paris (Both are playing together as Paris), and Marvin Achi.</p><p>Shubham Goel, a competitor from season 1, will also surprise viewers on the program, but it is unknown when he will return for The Circle season 5. The competitors will then rank other contestants according to their popularity and dynamic. The candidates with the fewest votes will be dropped. The last contestant will receive the $100,000 main prize, while the contestant with the highest public votes will receive $10,000.</p><p>The show’s final four seasons’ championships were won by three original players and one catfishing contestant. Deleesa St. Agathe won season 2 despite pretending to be her lover Trevor. Joey Sasso, James Andre Jefferson Jr., and Frank Grimsley successively won the first, third, and fourth seasons.</p><p>Before the show premiered, Tasia posted: “expectations should be ALL THE WAY DOWN in the Circle ⭕️, but they never are 😂 tune in tomorrow! <a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#explorepage</a>&nbsp;<a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#explore</a>&nbsp;<a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#tstonier</a>&nbsp;<a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#thecircle</a>&nbsp;<a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#thecirclenetflix</a>&nbsp;<a class="x1i10hfl xjbqb8w x6umtig x1b1mbwd xaqea5y xav7gou x9f619 x1ypdohk xt0psk2 xe8uvvx xdj266r x11i5rnm xat24cr x1mh8g0r xexx8yu x4uap5 x18d9i69 xkhd6sd x16tdsg8 x1hl2dhg xggy1nq x1a2a7pz _aa9_ _a6hd" tabindex=0 role=link href=#>#thecirclenetflix</a>.”</p><p>Just before the premiere, she posted another skit, about being entered on The Circle.
