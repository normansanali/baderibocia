They live together and while Aaron is off golfing in tournaments, Reagan is working in Las Vegas. She is a rare spectator at the golfer's games, maybe their infamous encounter on live TV was a massive deterrent.</p><p>There are golfers who bring their whole family to the final round so they can enjoy the game from the sidelines. Aaron did the same thing in 2018 when he was on the verge of winning his first PGA Tour. But his girlfriend Reagan was not there, arriving a little later to surprise him on the 18th hole.</p><p>The reason Aaron Wise and his girlfriend are popular among golf fans is because of what happened after Reagan won at Byron Nelson. As he was embraced by his friends and family, Reagan emerged and the couple did a hug. When they separated Aaron went in for the kiss only for his girlfriend to not get the signal as she pulled back.</p><p>That <a href=# rel=noopener>awkward moment</a> was captured on live TV and soon clips of the "friend-zoned" video started to appear on Twitter. News outlets and tabloids got in on the action with sensationalized headlines about Golfer getting rejected by his girlfriend, but as Aaron explained a few days later, the whole thing was a bit of an exaggeration.</p><p><strong>Also Read: <a href=# rel=bookmark>Ali Kershner Girlfriend – Stanford Sports Performance Coach’s Relationship Detail in 2021!</a></strong></p><span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-171 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-video ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>He <a href=# rel=noopener>told</a> Golf Digest, "We were just all so shocked, she was excited, I was excited, and at the moment she was kind of telling me what she had to do so I couldn’t see it and for the moment to be the way she wanted, and I kinda went in for a little kiss there and she didn’t even recognize it because she was too excited in the moment. It’s definitely been made a lot of. It’s funny, we’re rolling with it."</p><p>While the player said it was weird seeing his and his girlfriend's name in tabloids, Aaron understood it was all in good fun. But he was also nothing letting his gf live down that moment. As <a href=# rel=noopener>he explained</a>, "Yeah, I been giving her some sh*t about that. A lot has been made about that. It’s really nothing. We love each other a ton and we’re great.
