It is a powerful reminder that no matter what we are going through, God will always be there for us, ready to lift us up and hold us close.</p><p>When the lyrics ask, “Why are you striving these days? Why are you trying to earn grace? Why are you crying? Let me lift up your face, just don’t turn away,” it is a direct plea from God to stop trying to earn His love and grace through our own efforts. It’s a reminder that His love is freely given, and we simply need to accept it.</p><p>The song continues with the question, “Why are you looking for love? Why are you still searching as if I’m not enough? To where will you go, child? Tell me where will you run?” These words remind us that no matter how much we may search for love and fulfillment in other people or things, true satisfaction can only be found in a relationship with God.</p><p>The chorus of the song is an anthem of reassurance and comfort. It proclaims, “I’ll be by your side wherever you fall, in the dead of night whenever you call. And please don’t fight these hands that are holding you, my hands are holding you.” These words paint a beautiful picture of a loving, protective God who is always there to catch us when we fall and offer us solace in times of darkness.</p><p>The bridge of the song declares the unconditional love and commitment of God. It says, “I love you, I want you to know that I’ll love you, I’ll never let you go, no, no.” These words remind us that God’s love for us is unwavering and everlasting. He will never abandon us or let us go.</p><p>Personally, this song has had a profound impact on my life. There have been many moments when I felt lost, alone, and overwhelmed by the challenges I faced. In those times of despair, “By Your Side” served as a reminder that God was right there with me, ready to hold me and guide me through the storm.</p><p>During the darkest nights, when I couldn’t see a way out, this song reminded me to call on God, to surrender my burdens to Him, and to trust that He would never leave me. It brought me comfort, peace, and the reassurance that I was never alone.</p><p>There is something incredibly comforting about knowing that the creator of the universe is by our side, holding us in His hands. It gives us strength, hope, and the courage to keep moving forward, no matter what challenges we may face.</p><p>In conclusion, “By Your Side” by Tenth Avenue North is a truly powerful and uplifting song that reminds us of God’s unwavering love and presence in our lives. It serves as a beautiful reminder that we never have to face our struggles alone and that God is always there to hold us and guide us through it all.</p><p>So, the next time you find yourself feeling overwhelmed or lost, remember the words of this song and allow them to bring you comfort and strength. Know that God is by your side, ready to catch you, love you, and carry you through.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZminnJnBqrnEpqysoZNjsLC5jrBqaKyYmnquscCnoKefXZeyqbXNnWStoJViwLC6xmaZsmWppMKzedKim55lkq56tbHNrZ9mmaaau7axjKemq6yYZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
