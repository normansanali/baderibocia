The entrepreneur shared two sexy snaps with her 6.3 million Instagram followers on Sunday, April 12, wearing a satin red button-down and diamond-encrusted jewelry.

One Instagram user wrote, “You are so beautiful! Everyone wishes they looked this good eating a burger. 🖤” Another said, “Pass the fries sissy!!!

I’m going to gain weight. I know I keep bringing up the whole weight thing and the reason I do that is not because of my insecurities, but because of what I see on the Internet.</p><p></p><p>“Why is it all of a sudden OK to call people fat?” asked Hill. “You think I look bad? Imagine how I feel when everyone is saying these things to me. I’ve learned so much from the bad behavior of others.”</p><p>Hill isn’t the only social media star to share a <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">body-positive message</a> on social media recently.
