The British parenting guru never failed to drastically improve the behavior of the children she encountered.&nbsp;</p><p>And as of Jan. 1, it looks like Jo is back at it again. Fans will notice the reboot of Supernanny is a bit different than its first run on Lifetime. That's because instead of focusing on parents helping their naughty children, Jo will be tackling other common family issues as well.</p><p>"We're looking at families who have older children as well now," Jo <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">told Good Housekeeping</a> in December. "If you think about the first run of Supernanny, predominantly, it dealt with young children whose behavior was naughty. The Supernanny that you're going to see is about the whole family, with kids of all different types of ages. We're addressing not just behavior that has spiraled out of control. We're really taking a look at real families, and looking at the issues that they face every day."</p><p>As exciting as Jo's "return" is, it's not like she was sitting around doing nothing during her nearly decade-long Supernanny hiatus. She starred on the British series Killer Kids and Family S.O.S,, among other series. In light of her return to Supernanny, let's take a look at what's gone down in Jo's personal life in the past decade or so.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Michael Kovac/Getty</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Is Jo Frost married?</h2><p>She is! Jo is married to Darrin Jackson, a location coordinator whom she met on the set of Supernanny. Jo and Darrin live together in Orange County, California. ‚ÄúI‚Äôm so happy with him," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jo told the Daily Mail</a> in 2013. "We‚Äôve known each other for a long time and he‚Äôs supportive and ‚Äògets‚Äô the work I do‚Ä¶When I‚Äôm rushing around here, there and everywhere, he‚Äôs very much a strong support for me.</p><p>Fast-forward to 2015, and Jo confessed her seriously busy schedule had once been a source of strain in her relationship. ‚ÄúYou love what you do, but you love the man that you‚Äôre with, and you feel constantly torn because you love both," <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she told Entertainment Tonight</a> at the time. "Darrin is production manager on this show, so he gets to work with us. It almost didn‚Äôt work!‚Äù</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>My happy place HI !!!üòÅ</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Jo Frost | Supernanny</a> (@jofrost) on Sep 17, 2018 at 6:42pm PDT</p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-uxeQQ ibmIIm">Does Jo have any kids?</h2><p>The short answer to this is: No, Jo and Darrin do not currently have any children. With this in mind, the Supernanny hasn't ruled out parenthood by any means. In 2013, she shared with the Daily Mail she was in no rush to become a mom. "I‚Äôm not there right now," she told the publication. "I‚Äôm just enjoying my work and my time off, but I don‚Äôt feel my biological clock ticking."</p><p>Jo expressed the possibility of adoption as a way of starting a family, too. "I work a lot with families who adopt children and I‚Äôm passionate about adoption. There are so many children out there who need loving homes," she said. "So I would absolutely consider adoption. I definitely don‚Äôt feel that I have to give birth to a child in order to love them and be their mother."</p><p>In 2014, Jo echoed these sentiments in <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">an interview with The Mirror.</a> ‚ÄúThere are lots of wonderful options out there," she said. ‚ÄúSo whether we do it biologically or whether we don‚Äôt is something we have spoken about but that‚Äôs not going to happen right now.</p><p>Jo added, "I guess when the time comes when we feel, ‚ÄòOK, shall we then?‚Äô we‚Äôll proceed to do what we want to do.‚Äù</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="margin:8px 0 0;padding:0 4px"><a href=# style=color:#000;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none;word-wrap:break-word>Cancerians in their element! #piggybackride #familyfun #JoFrost #Supernanny</a></p><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap">A post shared by <a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px>Jo Frost | Supernanny</a> (@jofrost) on Aug 11, 2018 at 5:26pm PDT</p><span>Source: Instagram</span></figure><p>And there you have it! Jo is married, but doesn't currently have any children with her husband Darrin ‚Äî although the Supernanny star is certainly open to the idea. Whether or not she eventually has kids of her own, one thing's for sure. Parents across the world will continue to clamor for Jo's child-rearing advice.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfnsBuv9SpnKumkaO7unnMmqmroZWZ</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
