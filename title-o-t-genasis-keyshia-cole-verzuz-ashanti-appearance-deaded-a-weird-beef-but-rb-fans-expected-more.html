And it certainly didn’t help that she was less than enthusiastic when she finally did show up.</p><p>But finally the battle kicked off, and the two powerhouse R&B singers went hit for hit with tracks like Ashanti’s “Foolish,” “Baby” and “What’s Luv?” and Keyshia’s “Heaven Sent,” “You’ve Changed” and “Love” – with most viewers crowing the “Foolish” creator the winner at the end. However, the overall sentiment was that the whole show just wasn’t it.</p><p>“Last night’s #Verzuz was proof that some things are better left as ideas,” one viewer tweeted. “Between the lateness, Ashanti playing Candy Crush while Keyshia Cole was singing her songs and having an open bar, it was a mess!
