Prosecutors from Broward County, who sought the death penalty, are likely to opt for a retrial with a new jury, as a unanimous verdict is necessary for conviction or acquittal of a defendant.</p><p>Broward Circuit Judge John Murphy urged the jurors to continue deliberating twice after they reported being deadlocked. However, upon their third deadlock, the judge relented.</p><p>Demons, now 24, has pleaded not guilty and could face death sentence if found guilty.</p><p>According to prosecutors, Demons, Williams, and Thomas, were in a Jeep driven by Cortland Henry, also known as YNW Bortlen, after a recording session in Fort Lauderdale on Oct. 26, 2018, where Demons allegedly shot Williams and Thomas. Henry is charged as an accomplice and will be tried separately.</p><p>Williams and Thomas, part of the YNW collective, were fatally shot while inside the Jeep. Prosecutors claim it was part of a gang action, but the defense argues against this, highlighting the close friendship between Demons and the victims as evidence.</p><p>Following the killings, prosecutors allege that Demons and Henry drove the bodies to an area near the Everglades, where they staged a drive-by shooting to cover up the crime. However, ballistics tests indicate that the victims were shot from inside the Jeep.</p><p>The defense emphasized the lack of recovery of the gun and argued that YNW Melly had no apparent motive for the crime.</p><p>Thomas, also known as YNW Juvy, and Williams, known as YNW Sakchaser, were childhood friends of Demons and part of the YNW collective.</p><br><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimlazAr7vWp6CgnaKerm%2B6xmikoqukp7aiuIydnJykkaeypXnIp2SrmaClsrN52KeuZqWVobm6v4ydpq6anJp6rsHRnZyrZaSntqK4jg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
