"When in Paris, it's all about being fancy—stuff of that sort," Chamberlain says while in her glam chair. "When I first started going to Louis Vuitton shows, I was giving cute, innocent, young woman. But I'm 20 now. I'm not a little girl anymore, and so I'm trying to give drama now."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Her outfit of the day certainly reflects the intention. Flaunting all black, head-to-toe Louis Vuitton, Chamberlain's final look features a cropped graphic muscle tank, skinny leather pants, and a chained shoulder bag for the day's events—topped off with an intense smoky eye and coffee in hand.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Chamberlain sits front row at the fashion show, which showcases <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.instagram.com/nicolasghesquiere/?hl=en" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Nicolas Ghesquière" class="body-link css-1xesb7e emevuu60">Nicolas Ghesquière</a>'s contrasting and playful fall/winter 2022 collection. "There were so many looks that are literally things that I would wear on a day-to-day basis," she says of the collection. "You just can't go wrong with the LV show. It's always perfect." The pieces also match her laid-back, gender-fluid style—from the dress shirts with the tees to the big blazers. "I'm obsessed with that," she adds. "So many cool textures, so much cool stuff."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Newly inspired from the show's pieces, Chamberlain later heads over to a vintage store to put together her own fits—and to "flex" that she "got that from a vintage store in Paris." Some of these cool finds for Chamberlain include an oversized men's jacket and a hooded tank minidress. "There's a lot to sort through and many different vibes," she adds. "You kind of have to be patient to find things that fit you best, but it's very worth it."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She also demonstrates her resourcefulness with hidden gems and DIYs. "We're gonna turn this into something. Just wait," she says with a scarf and necklace in hand. Moments later, she steps out of the dressing room in what is now an impressively sophisticated DIY halter top. "Editor, turn the music on. We're doing a montage."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Chamberlain closes out her afternoon tending to priorities: more coffee, which she chugs to make it to her dinner party. "This is coffee number four of the day," Chamberlain admits. "By the end of today, I'll be at 45, probably. That's just the way."</p><span class="css-3mrz81 ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/ef84b592-a2b0-47e0-8e6c-e29e8d3ddc25_1619719162.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Sabrina Park" title="Headshot of Sabrina Park" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Sabrina Park is a Digital Fellow at <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">HarpersBAZAAR.com</a> where she covers news, fashion, and culture stories.
