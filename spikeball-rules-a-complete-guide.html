This results in a point for the serving team.</p><p>Serving<br data-mce-fragment=1>The game begins with one team serving the ball by hitting it onto the net. The server must stand at least 6 feet away from the net and make a clean hit to start the game.</p><p>Rally and Hits<br data-mce-fragment=1>After the serve, the opposing team has up to three hits to return the ball back onto the net. The hits can be strategic, aiming to catch the opposing team off guard.</p><p>Scoring<br data-mce-fragment=1>Points are scored when the opposing team fails to return the ball onto the net, or if they hit the ball out of bounds. The receiving team gains the right to serve after scoring a point.</p><p>Rotation<br data-mce-fragment=1>Players must rotate positions after each point is scored to ensure fairness and equal participation among teammates.</p><p>Faults<br data-mce-fragment=1>Several faults can occur during a Spikeball game, including:</p><p>Holding or Carrying<br data-mce-fragment=1>: Players cannot hold or carry the ball during play.</p><p>Double Hits<br data-mce-fragment=1>: A player cannot hit the ball twice in succession.</p><p>Out of Bounds<br data-mce-fragment=1>: If the ball touches the ground or goes out of bounds, the opposing team gains a point.</p><p>Winning the Game<br data-mce-fragment=1>The first team to reach 21 points with a lead of at least 2 points wins the game. If the game reaches a score of 20-20, teams must continue playing until one team gains a 2-point advantage.</p><p>Advanced Rules and Strategies<br data-mce-fragment=1>As players become more experienced in Spikeball, they may explore advanced rules and strategies to enhance their gameplay.
