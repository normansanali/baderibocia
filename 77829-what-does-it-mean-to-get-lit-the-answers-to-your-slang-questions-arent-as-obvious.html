I know what you all are thinking — to be lit must mean to be high. To be fair, that<i> is </i>certainly the most used definition of the word; in fact, the most popular <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>Urban Dictionary definition of "lit"</a> is, "The state of being so intoxicated (regardless of the intoxicating agent) that all the person can do is smile, so that they look lit up like a light." Whether you've actually recently lit a joint or are just super <a href=# class=T3D>turnt</a> on tequila shots, getting and being lit via intoxicant is certainly a common use of the word.</p><p>But what does lit mean when it's <i>not</i> used in reference to the intoxicated self? Let us once again turn to Urban Dictionary for some guidance:</p><h3>Definition One:</h3><p>"When something is <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>turned up or popping</a>."</p><h3>Definition Two:</h3><p>"Something that is fucking <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>amazing in any sense</a>."</p><h3>Definition Three:</h3><p>"The act of which <a href=# rel=noreferrer class=T3D>a person is excited</a>, or hype due to an upcoming event."</p><p>In addition to a person being turnt, being "lit" can also describe an exciting event, a cool person, or general awesomeness.</p><p>How about a few examples? First, we see "lit" being used every which way in A$AP Rocky's song "Get Lit":</p><p></p><p>In the song, he's quite obviously talking about getting high; however, he's also talking about the good times he's excited for (namely the good times that will be associated with girls, clubs, Swishers) and the people he's excited to have those good times with (shoutout to Fat Tony). It's clear that the while the weed is certainly lit, so are A$AP's girls and friends.</p><p>We also hear the word emphasized in ILOVEMAJONNEN's "Tuesday," when Drake says, "Tell Gelo bring the juice, we about to get lit":</p><p></p><p>It's clear that like A$AP, Drake and company are going to be getting lit on drugs and alcohol — but it's also clear that the club itself is pretty lit, too.</p><p>So remember kids, there's more than one way to get lit. It's all about doing it safely, with the people you love, and maybe on a Tuesday if the club is going up.</p><p><i>Image: Giphy</i></p><p>Get Even More From Bustle — Sign Up For The Newsletter</p><p>From hair trends to relationship advice, our daily newsletter has everything you need to sound like a person who’s on TikTok, even if you aren’t.</p><p>More like this</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7o8HSraOeZpOkunCt0a2gnKSVqHx4g5drcGavmJbBbrDOnqpmoaRiuqatzWarqGWXmsFuuMitZK2glWKur7%2FWnqmsZaSkerq71KtkrKSRo7RuvdSeqq2hn6PAbq3RnqWtZZGoerCu1aKmrqs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
