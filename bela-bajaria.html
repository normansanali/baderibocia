My family said, “You should do this. You’d meet Indian girls from all over the world.” The pageant made me embrace Indian culture on my terms. People were surprised that I won, but I think I did well because there were no stakes in it for me. I was confident because I didn’t have my identity riding on it.”</p><p>In 2006, she recalled the days when she was a contestant in Indian American pageant. Sharing her memories of the pageant contest, she said,</p><p>I took the title very seriously. I used my platform to talk about the issues that really concerned me.
