So, it was an exciting morning.”</p><p>She added that the honour “shines a light” on gymnastics after the sport went through a dark time following the conviction of U.S. Olympic team doctor Larry Nassar on charges of criminal sexual conduct.</p><p>Simone added: “It’s so incredible. We’ve had kind of a cloud over it the last couple of years so to put some sunshine feels good.”</p><p>When asked what message she’d like to send to young women, Simone replied: “To just speak up, use your platforms. Be authentic to yourself, and stay true to yourself and just go out there and have fun in whatever your adventure is.”</p><p>She went on: “You can do anything you put your mind to.”</p><p>Simone can now look forward to the future as she’s busy planning her wedding to NFL star Jonathan Owens. They have set a date for their big day – revealing they will tie the knot in 2023. The Olympic medallist got engaged to Jonathan, 26, back in February after almost 18 months of dating.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmhqZGy7psPSmqmorZ6Zwamx1qippZxemLyue8Keo56aXZy2tMCOrKCmp56aeqO1y56qZqqVmLKqwsSsZJqllae2pK3SZqernaOesaa606KYpWWdmrGiuIyonWaeopqypbvMaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
