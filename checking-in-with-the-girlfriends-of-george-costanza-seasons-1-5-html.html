But Chartoff’s non-Larry David career is quite impressive, too, including voicing Didi Pickles on Rugrats and appearing as Principal Musso on Parker Lewis Can’t Lose. She’s also accomplished something no other Seinfeld actor or actress has: she helped invent something, specifically the Gray Water Recycling System, a device that allowed the reuse of shower and sink water. Chartoff has written humor columns for The Huffington Post and The Jewish Journal, and in 2007, she wrote and starred in Taught 2 Dance, a “silly, bittersweet tale of being born a performer and growing up to become a real person,” according to the show’s description.
