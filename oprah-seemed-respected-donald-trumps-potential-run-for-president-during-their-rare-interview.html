His potential political aspirations started even before his convo with Ripa. Given a past interview with <strong><a href=#>Oprah Winfrey</a></strong> during the '80s, it seems evident Trump had a major interest for politics. We'll take a look back at his conversation with Oprah, and how the two once had a mutual respect for one another before their relationship soured.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=oprah-winfrey-once-wrote-a-letter-to-donald-trump-supporting-his-political-career-in-the-early-2000s>Oprah Winfrey Once Wrote A Letter To Donald Trump Supporting His Political Career In The Early 2000s</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/instar49334701.jpg><p>Former President Donald Trump plans to release a book which will also include private letters from higher ups he bonded with along the way. Among those people includes Oprah, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">who had actually endorsed a possible political run with Donald</a>. She wrote in the note, "Too bad we're not running for office."</p><p>Oprah did respond to the reveal of the note, downplaying it and claiming that she was just trying to supportive at the time. Writing a note was a norm for Oprah.</p><p>"And when I heard that this letter is now going to be a part of a book, I thought, 'Oh, wasn't that nice of me to write a note.' That's what I thought, because I'm always like, 'Oh, I should write a note. The person did this, or I should write a note,'" she said.

Trump would take to Twitter and question some of Oprah's tactics.</p><p>He tweeted out, "Just watched a very insecure Oprah Winfrey, who at one point I knew very well, interview a panel of people on 60 Minutes. The questions were biased and slanted, the facts incorrect.
