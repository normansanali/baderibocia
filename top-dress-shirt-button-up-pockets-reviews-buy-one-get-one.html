Classic dress shirts give us a specific kind of confidence. It’s one that assures us that we’re not underdressed, that the rest of our outfit is bound to match and that people are going to take us more seriously. It’s great to have this kind of confidence, of course. But why should we stop there?"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

It’s one that assures us that we’re not underdressed, that the rest of our outfit is bound to match and that people are going to take us more seriously. It’s great to have this kind of confidence, of course. But why should we stop there? Does wearing a dress shirt mean we have to give up feeling beautiful? Absolutely not!</p><p>The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Slim Fit Convertible Sleeve Portofino Shirt from Express</a> is taking the idea of a dress shirt and merging it with effortless style to make sure that when we put it on, we’re not only feeling confident in the situation we’re in, but in ourselves, too. The result is a top that can “go from the office to happy hour in seconds.” With a more relaxed fit than a typical dress shirt and a semi-sheer fabric, it’s easy to see its versatility. Since it’s so versatile, we might as well buy two while this BOGO sale is going on!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Portofino-Shirt-Black.jpg><p><strong>See it: Check out the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Slim Fit Convertible Sleeve Portofino Shirt</a> for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$50</a> from Express! Buy one, get another for 50% off!</strong></p><p>Almost 900 shoppers have expressed their love for this <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Portofino shirt</a>, calling it “high quality,” “flattering” and a “favorite” of all time. One called it “even better than the original” Portofino shirt, its slim cut tailored for a more contemporary fit. Everyone is commenting on its wear-everywhere prospects, saying that it’s great for anything from work to clubbing and all that’s in between!</p><p>This shirt is a button-up, but only buttons up far enough to form a V-neck rather than a round neckline. We’re already loving this. At the top of the V is the point collar, still giving us professional vibes with hints of classy-cool. Down at the bottom of the shirt is a shirttail hem, which hangs long enough that it’s able to be easily tucked into jeans, slacks or a skirt.</p><p>The sleeves of this shirt are long, but only when we want them to be! They have buttoned roll tabs, allowing us to convert them into three-quarter-length sleeves whenever we want so we can fit any season or scenario. Also on this <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Portofino shirt</a> are two front patch pockets, which not only look cute, but help to create a more opaque effect on top of the semi-sheer material.</p><p>We really like a good semi-sheer shirt. Don’t want it to be semi-sheer? Just throw on a cami or bodysuit underneath! One hack is that we can also put on a bandeau-style bra and wear high-waisted bottoms. Done and done. If we want that sheerness factor, then boom, it’s already there. Put on a contrasting bra to add just a little extra hint of style or color to an outfit!</p><p>This shirt is currently available in four colors, but because of its popularity, it may not be for long. For the classic of classics, there’s White, which features both white fabric and white buttons. Sure, a white button-up is a classic, but there’s a big difference between wearing this top and another, regular dress shirt. The comfort, the flattering fit and the slim cut are just the start of it!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/Portofino-Shirt-Blue.jpg><p><strong>See it: Check out the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Slim Fit Convertible Sleeve Portofino Shirt</a> for <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">$50</a> from Express! Buy one, get another for 50% off!</strong></p><p>If we want to take it in the complete opposite direction, we can go for Pitch Black, which continues the matching fabric and buttons theme. Black is an ever-reliable color, and on this Portofino shirt, we love it that much more!</p><p>If we want to dip our toes into the pool of colors, why not start with Ink Blue? It’s a sapphire shade, brighter than navy but darker than cobalt. Pair this color with black or light-wash bottoms. We suggest playing with another color for shoes and accessories, like a pink, yellow or bright red!</p><p>Last is Fresh Mint, which is selling out of certain sizes. The people can recognize a great shade when they see one! This color is light and a bit bright, but not loud. We can still keep it low-key in this icy shade by sticking with neutrals for the rest of our outfit. Obviously, though, we’re not going to be able to resist a bold lip, nor should we!</p><p>We need to go make sure we secure the colors calling our name while the BOGO deal on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this shirt</a> is still going.
