After much build-up and a few teasing photos of her in the makeup chair before her annual Halloween bash, the Project Runway host finally revealed her 2013 Halloween costume on the night of Thursday, Oct. 31 — herself, a few decades into the future, as an old woman.</p><p>"Happy Halloween!" Klum <a href=#>captioned</a> a picture of herself en route to the Shutterfly and Svedka-sponsored fete at New York City hotspot Marquee.</p><p>The 40-year-old German stunner completely transformed herself for the big event, with ultra-realistic age spots on her body and raised varicose veins running up her famously long legs. Gone were her trademark blonde tresses; in their place was a stringy, white wig.</p><p>Klum's face was unrecognizable, too. Her normally taut skin appeared to sag, and there were wrinkles all over her forehead, chin, and neck. She wore a pearl necklace, printed top, and a houndstooth suit, and she had a black cane to help her walk.&nbsp;</p><p>Elaborate, jaw-dropping costumes are the supermodel's trademark. In the past, she has transformed herself into Cleopatra (2012), an ape (2011), an alien robot (2010), a black crow (2009), and a Hindu goddess (2008). Speaking about her penchant for killer Halloween getups in an interview with <a href=#>Parade</a> earlier this month, the stunning supermodel said she puts a lot of thought into every costume.</p><p>"I start thinking of ideas months before Halloween, and I have an amazing team who makes the impossible possible," she told the mag. "I don't really have a system for picking my costume each year, they just kind of come to me. It's definitely not a last-minute decision. It takes months of preparation."</p><p>Klum's party guests should take note. "I want people to strive to have a better costume than me," she added. "I want my guests to really wow me! It's so much fun when I'm looking at someone in their costume and it takes me a few minutes to figure out it is one of my closest friends!"</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>"I take Halloween very seriously, so I'm not a fan of a thrown-together costume," she added, "but in an absolute pinch, look around at what items you have around your house. You'd be surprised what you can come up with. Or cut two holes in a bed sheet and be a ghost. But seriously, I'd rather stay home than go out in an uninspired costume."</p><p>Tell Us: What do you think of Heidi Klum's 2013 Halloween costume?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGahnZmZtm63y66kZqqVq7KiuNJmaWlpY2K1orjLqK6enZ5isLC%2F066knmWZqHqku8ypo56slaHGbsHNq5ycp5ejtrutwaWcZpmjYq6vec6lm2akkZnGbrzInKuuqpVif3F9kmxoamhf</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
