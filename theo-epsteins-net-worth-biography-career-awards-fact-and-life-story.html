Originally from Boston, Epstein comes from a line of successful people. His grandfather and great uncle actually won Academy Awards for the screenplay for Casablanca back in 1943. His father was the head writer of the Creative Writing program at Boston University and his sister was the head writer of two separate TV shows. Theo, in hopes to keep up with the success of his family, went to Yale and was a sports editor. Eventually becoming the head of PR for the Padres, he had his eyes set on eventually working for the Boston Red Sox. In 2002 that chance came along, when he was appointed to replace the interim GM Mike Port. Theo Epstein served as GM of the Red Sox until 2011. During his time with the Red Sox, Epstein was instrumental in helping the team end their championship drought. In 2011, Epstein signed a five year $18.5 million contract to become the GM of the Chicago Cubs. He re-signed with the Cubs in 2016 with a 5-year $50 million deal.</p><p><strong>Theo Epstein Salary</strong><br>What is Theo Epstein’s salary as General Manager of The Chicago Cubs? $10&nbsp;million per year</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaKyYmrxusc%2Bsq56hnqh6r7HTZq6oqqSdeqO1zqCpmqiYrnqkrdGenKtlkayus7DSZp2am6Rirq%2BwjKWgn51dqMGwvtho</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
