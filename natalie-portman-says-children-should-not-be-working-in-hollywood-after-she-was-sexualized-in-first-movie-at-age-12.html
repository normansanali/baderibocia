However, the Oscar-winner, now 42, doesn’t believe that children should be working in Hollywood.
“I would not encourage young people to go into this. I don’t mean ever; I mean as children,” Portman told Variety recently. Portman doesn’t regret starting her own acting career in her pre-teen years because her parents were able to watch over her while she was on set."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

If someone respects you, they’re not going to objectify you.”</p><p>She sighed: “At that age you do have your own sexuality, and you do have your own desire and you do want to explore things … but you don’t feel safe necessarily. You build these fortresses.”&nbsp;</p><p>In 2018, Portman recalled how males over-sexualized her when she was a teenager. She recounted at the <a href=#>Women’s March</a> how when she opened her fan mail, there would be rape fantasies that men had written about her.</p><p>&nbsp;“A countdown was started on my local radio show to my 18th birthday, euphemistically the date that I would be legal to sleep with. Movie reviewers talked about my budding breasts in reviews,” Portman revealed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmimqaW8tMCNnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGpma21fmru1sdGtmKKmnZq7tXvNmquapJmaerG70a2kmqZdqK66v4ycn6KklKeyr3nSoaaupJRiu7DAjJucZq%2Bfp7iqusZmoKdlmKS5rcXWqKadZZGbwaa%2BjKyfnmWnlsBuv8SxrJqkma%2BypXnIp2SfoaKowW65zq%2BgnmWRqXqis8RmaGtn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
