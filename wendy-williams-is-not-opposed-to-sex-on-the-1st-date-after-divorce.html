“As long as he’s virus-free, I’m not opposed to sex on the first date,” the Wendy Williams Show host, 56, told Mario Lopez on Access Hollywood on Thursday, February 25. “I am not opposed to any of that.”
Due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic and the winter weather, dating has not been a walk in the park for Williams as of late."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

I like to hold hands,” she explained. “But I want a boyfriend, and you just can’t make it happen. You have to put yourself out there, you know? And so, it’s weird because it’s so cold here in New York and there’s been so much snow, although twentysomething more days until spring.”</p><p>While the Emmy nominee wants to have fun, she is not opposed to settling down again either.</p><p>“I want to have a good time and eventually have the love with the same man,” she said. “I’m not pushing love, but I tend to fall in like very easily, and there’s nothing wrong with that.”</p><p>As for the prospect of marrying again, Williams said that she “would not” be opposed to it “a couple of years” down the road.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/Wendy-Williams-Says-She-Is-Not-Opposed-to-Sex-on-the-1st-Date-Access-Mario-Lopez.jpg><p>“I wouldn’t want to get married right away,” she explained. “I’m only opposed to things like, we’re not going to live together unless we live at your place and it’s just large enough for both of us. I need closet room. I am not getting rid of my apartment, so I will always have a place to run and call my own. You’re not moving in with me, I’m not moving in with you. … I don’t want to be a stepmother. I like kids, but no. [My son] Kevin is 20.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>The Ask Wendy author was previously married to <a href=#><strong>Kevin Hunter</strong></a>.
