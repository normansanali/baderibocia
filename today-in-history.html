Many continued to operate in secret, however, which led to the crucifixion of 26 Christians in Nagasaki in 1597.

Just 14 years later, Till was gruesomely murdered in Money, Mississippi, after he was accused of catcalling a white woman storekeeper. Till’s mother, <a href=# rel=noopener>Mamie Till-Mobley</a>, famously kept his coffin open at his funeral, and the resulting photographs of the 14-year-old’s battered body helped spark the burgeoning civil rights movement.</p><h2>1972: The Tuskegee Experiment Is Revealed</h2><p>The U.S. public learns about the <a href=# rel=noopener>Tuskegee experiment</a> for the first time. The experiment, which endured from 1932 until 1972, studied the progression of untreated syphilis in poor Black men.
