In a February 2020 <a href=#>New York Times</a> profile, <a href=#>he showed his support</a> for ex-fiancée <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Lopez</strong></a>&nbsp;after her 2020 Academy Awards snub for her work in Hustlers.</p><p>“She should have been nominated. She’s the real thing. I keep in touch periodically with her and have a lot of respect for her,” he told the publication at the time. “How awesome is it that she had her biggest hit movie at 50? That’s f–king baller.”</p><p>Luckily, the Argo producer’s sweet words did him some good. In May 2021, Us Weekly <a href=#>confirmed the pair were back together</a> after splitting more than a decade earlier.</p><p>“The old flame is absolutely rekindled. They picked up where they left off in terms of affection for each other,” a source shared at the time. In April 2022, Lopez confirmed that the couple were officially engaged for the second time. Three months later, the pair tied the knot in Las Vegas.</p><p>But let’s rewind! The Reindeer Games actor’s longest relationship began in 2004 with <a href=#><strong>Jennifer Garner</strong></a>, whom he began dating after breaking his engagement to the “I’m Real” singer and pursuing an on-and-off romance with <a href=#><strong>Gwyneth Paltrow</strong></a>. The exes — who share daughters Violet and Seraphina and son Samuel — were married from June 2005 until <a href=#>they announced their separation in June 2015</a>.</p><p>Despite their split, the 13 Going on 30 actress has become someone Affleck can turn to in his time of need, <a href=#>including during his recovery journey</a>. “Jen has always been the person who can get through to him,” an insider told Us in 2017. “She keeps Ben in line as much as she can.”</p><p>In August 2019, a source told Us exclusively that Affleck and Garner were doing “amazingly well at coparenting” their children together.</p><p>In addition to his romances with Garner, Lopez and Paltrow, he has also been rumored to have dated quite a few other costars. Affleck sparked dating speculation with <strong>Salma Hayek</strong> in 1999 and <strong>Jaime King</strong> in 2001, to name a few. But after his broken marriage to Garner, he says he’s&nbsp;holding out for the real thing.</p><p>“I would love to have a relationship that was deeply meaningful,” Affleck told <a href=#>Good Morning America</a>’s <a href=#><strong>Diane Sawyer</strong></a> in February 2020. “And one to which I could be deeply committed.”</p><p>Us exclusively revealed in March 2020 that <a href=#>Affleck was dating</a> his Deep Water costar&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Ana De Armas</strong></a>. “Ben <a href=#>is very supportive</a> of Ana and <a href=#>tells her how amazing she is</a>,” an insider told Us at the time “Ana’s friends are constantly telling her how lucky she is to have Ben and think he is so charming, cool and fun. They’re so happy for her.”</p><p>However, the duo called it quits in January 2021 — months before he found his way back to Lopez.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>“Friends say they can see them staying together forever this time around,” <a href=#>a source shared of the Gigli costars</a> in June 2021. “They are soulmates and always have been.”</p><p>Scroll down to see Affleck’s greatest loves and flings throughout the years.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8sbXCrayrnaNkr6a6jJqdn6SVmLi0ecOaq6Kml2K1qr%2FTqKmyZZqau6%2B1xZ6pZp%2BRp7umvoyjnKemmZuys3nLqKeesl2ivLOxjg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
