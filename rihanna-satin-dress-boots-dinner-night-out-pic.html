The dress featured a midi length — just below Riri’s knees — and complimented the star effortlessly. Rihanna paired her dress with <a href=#>a set of pointed toe boots</a> that rested just above her ankles. Topping off the look, Rihanna added an aviator jacket which featured hues of mocha and taupe. Along with her look, she also wore a black face mask to keep herself and those around her safe amid the COVID-19 pandemic.<p id=content-paragraph-4>Rihanna has seriously been giving fans so much life with her fashion choices as of late. The singer proved that she was wholly ready for spring when she stepped out on March 19 in <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a pastel look</a>. The coat was a vintage piece by&nbsp;<strong>Chanel</strong> and featured hues of pink and blue, while the blue necklace she wore was <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>a stunning ’90s accessory</a> by <strong>Dior</strong> by <strong>John Galliano</strong>. You can see the ensemble below!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hollywoodlife.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/rihanna-pastel-outfit-mega-embed.jpg>Rihanna’s style has been giving off major ’90s vibes, but we’re not surprised that the mogul is jumping on reimagined trends from decades ago. Rihanna has always been an icon in the world of fashion, and <a href=#>her inclusive platform</a> when it comes to Savage X Fenty has inspired millions. While Rihanna has been looking ready for spring with her own looks that she’s sported while out and about, she’s also shown that her label is ready to head into the new season.<p id=content-paragraph-6>Prior to her latest outings, Rihanna debuted the <a href=# data-analytics-trigger=article-body-link>Savage X Fenty spring collection</a>. Much like her recent vintage looks, the collection features a slew of ’60s inspired floral patterns and cuts, perfect for a sexy throwback to make any person feel confident. We love seeing Rihanna’s style evolution continue to unfold and we cannot wait to see what trend she tries next!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmign6G5usPOqJuloZaae6S7zGhpaWphZH10e5FtZquhmJa7r62MrJitoZ5isbOx0qxkm6efqcBusMinpZ6qXaO2qLTTZqaurF2ltqR7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
