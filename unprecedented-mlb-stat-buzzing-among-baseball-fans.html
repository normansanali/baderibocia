I wasn't nervous as much as I was fighting myself to keep my concentration. When I lose my concentration, I pipe the ball, throw it down the middle and give up maybe four or five hits in a row or else walk everybody. For about the last three innings I really had to fight myself to keep my head in the game. But this was the biggest thrill of all, bigger than last time because this was my type of game."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qL7Up56eZpOkunB9km9tcm5oZMKvvNGemp6claPBprCMpqObZaOprrV5wa6xs6GenHqiuc6nnmaakaiyo63LpWSfmZ6ofA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
