That’s right, the sitcom about a wisecracking alien who moves in with a regular American family is currently attracting more eyeballs than Ross, Rachel, and the gang.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/ALF.jpg><p data-characters=343 data-current-count=643 data-injectable=true>Running from 1986 to 1990 for a total of 102 episodes, ALF (which stands for Alien Life Form) follows the misadventures of the eponymous extraterrestrial and the Tanner family, who take him in after he crash-lands in their garage, as they attempt to keep ALF’s existence a secret from both the U.S. government and their nosy neighbors.</p><p data-characters=447 data-current-count=447 data-injectable=true>Despite ALF’s enormous popularity, he hasn’t been seen on our screens since his little-remembered 1996 spinoff movie, Project: ALF. That’s not for lack of trying, though, as Sony attempted to develop an animated film, in the vein of the Smurfs franchise, in the early 2010s, while Warner Bros. announced a live-action reboot of the TV series was in the works in 2018. For whatever reason, neither project ended up going anywhere.</p><p data-characters=306 data-current-count=306 data-injectable=false>If ALF is managing to beat out Friends on streaming, however, that must prove that audiences — particularly those of a certain age — still have enough affection for him to warrant another attempt at a reboot, probably as a HBO Max original. Basically, ALF needs to come back, and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">not just in Pog form</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y1tMisZJytnKl6eXzSZqqhp6ditrR5z6umr6GenHquu9GeZKmnoKq5or6MrZ%2Bapl2bv6qxzZ2qZqeeYsC1vsSapKKml2Q%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
