Her mother Tina Knowles-Lawson was born on January 4, 1954, and her husband Jay-Z was born on December 4, 1969.</p><p>These three dates have reportedly led Beyoncé to believe that the number holds incredible meaning for her and her family.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>The Touching Story Behind How Beyoncé Got Her Name</a></span></p><p>It seems that Jay-Z also believes in numerology since his 13th album was titled 4:44. When explaining the meaning of the record during a 2017 interview, he revealed the importance of the number in his life.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“4:44 is a song that I wrote, and it's the crux of the album, just right in the middle of the album," he said (via Nicki Swift). "And I woke up, literally, at 4:44 in the morning, 4:44 AM, to write this song. So it became the title of the album and everything. It's the title track because it's such a powerful song, and I just believe one of the best songs I've ever written."</p><h2 id=how-did-beyonc-eacute-choose-her-other-kids-rsquo-names>How Did Beyoncé Choose Her Other Kids’ Names?</h2><p>Did numerology <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">inspire all of Beyoncé's children's names?</a></p><p>Blue’s middle name Ivy is rumored to be inspired by the Roman numeral IV, while her first name is reportedly an ode to Beyoncé’s favorite color, blue.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=#>Beyoncé's Mom Shares Another Secret To B's Success</a></span></p><p>Not long after giving birth to Blue in January 2012, Beyoncé posted an excerpt from A Field Guide to Getting Lost by Rebecca Solnit, explaining the significance of the color blue.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>“The world is blue at its edges and in its depths,” the excerpt read (via Cheat Sheet). “This blue is the light that got lost. Water is colorless, shallow water appears to be the color of whatever lies underneath it, but deep water is full of this scattered light, the purer the water the deeper the blue.”</p><p>On June 13 (1+3 = 4), 2017, Beyoncé’s twins Rumi and Sir Carter were born. According to Cheat Sheet, Jay-Z explained that Rumi’s name was inspired by the 13th-century Persian poet and lyricist who was also a mystic and Islamic scholar.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In the same interview, Jay-Z explained the inspiration behind Sir’s name, revealing that it was mostly down to the baby’s swagger:</p><p>“Sir was like, man, come out the gate. He carries himself like that. He just came out, like, Sir.”</p><p>Beyoncé has given a limited number of interviews since the twins were born in 2017.
