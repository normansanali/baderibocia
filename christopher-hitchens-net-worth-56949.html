He had the courage to accept the world for just what it is and not what he wanted it to be. That's the highest praise, I believe, one can give to any intellect. He understood that the universe doesn't care about our existence or welfare and he epitomized the realization that our lives have meaning only to the extent that we give them meaning." Bill Maher paid tribute to Hitchens on his show <i>Real Time with Bill Maher</i>, saying, "We lost a hero of mine, a friend, and one of the great talk show guests of all time." <a href=#>Salman</a> Rushdie and <a href=#>English</a> <a href=#>Comedian</a> Stephen Fry paid tribute at the Christopher Hitchens <a href=#>Vanity</a> Fair Memorial 2012. Three weeks before Hitchens's death, George Eaton of the <i>New Statesman</i> wrote, "He is determined to ensure that he is not remembered simply as a 'lefty who turned right' or as a contrarian and provocateur. Throughout his career, he has retained a commitment to the Enlightenment values of reason, secularism and pluralism. His targets—Mother Teresa, Bill Clinton, Henry Kissinger, God—are chosen not at random, but rather because they have offended one or more of these principles. The tragedy of Hitchens' illness is that it came at a time when he enjoyed a larger audience than ever. The great polemicist is certain to be remembered, but, as he is increasingly aware, perhaps not as he would like." <i>The Chronicle of Higher Education</i> asked if Hitchens was the last public intellectual.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrDOpaWerKekv7W0jZympmeTnb%2Bqv9Oop6GdomK1qsDCoZynq12jsrV51qipraBdaoN6gJg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
