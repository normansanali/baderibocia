"I'd like to thank the talented cast, producers, and crew for all their hard work and dedication to the series. We are very proud of the West Beverly High alumni."</p><p>90210, the fourth series in the Beverly Hills, 90210 franchise from the 1990s, premiered to great expectations in 2008. It stars <strong>AnnaLynne McCord</strong>, <a href=#><strong>Shenae Grimes</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Matt Lanter</strong></a>, <strong>Jessica Stroup</strong>, and <strong>Jessica Lowndes</strong>, among others. (Beverly Hills, 90210 alum <a href=#><strong>Jennie Garth</strong></a> appeared in Seasons 1 and 2 to help launch the series but was later written out.)</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Lanter, who plays bad boy Liam Court on the soap, spoke recently to <a href=#>Bullett</a> about the uncertainty of the show's future. "There's always something new on the horizon," he said in response to a question about his next project. "But right now, we don't know if we're coming back or not for 90210. We're kind of in this limbo area…I think if we are back for season six, there's gonna be some major changes that take place for the characters."</p><p>Alas, fans will never know what changes the writers may have had in store, but there's still plenty of drama left before the series ends. <strong>Michael Jackson</strong>'s son<strong> Prince Michael Jackson</strong> is set to make his acting debut on the finale, and the recently reunited Fall Out Boy will perform on an April episode.</p><p>Tell <strong>Us</strong>: Are you sad to see 90210 end?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaHBpamFleqStzZycpZ2UYq%2B6edOhnGabp2Kup8DEq2SfoaaaerSxwKymp6tdZ31yf5FxaWg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
