One type in particular is back in a big way: We're talking about blunt bangs.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From Emily Ratajkowski to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Florence Pugh</a>, our favorite celebs are proving that blunt bangs are that girl. Plus, if you've been feeling nostalgic lately, with a FYP filled with clips of New Girl or The Devil Wears Prada, chances are high that blunt bangs are top of mind — and for good reason. "Blunt bangs are a very flattering look for all face shapes, and a quick way to change up your look entirely in one haircut," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>Andrew Fitzsimons</a>, celebrity hairstylist and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>Andrew Fitzsimons Haircare</a>. "They work really well on thicker hair, given that the straight and blunt cut gives an edgier, bold look."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you've made the executive decision that you want to get blunt bangs, there are a few things to keep in mind before committing to them. Here, we break down everything you need to know to take care of and style your blunt bangs.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-are-blunt-bangs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What Are Blunt Bangs?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To put it bluntly (pun intended), blunt bangs fall straight across the forehead, says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Bumble and bumble</a> hairstylist Megan Norris; they can hit right at the brow line or be micro in length. "There are no flowy or feathered ends to the bangs, and they fall straight across your forehead," adds Fitzsimons. "Other bangs, such as curtain bangs or layered bangs, have more movement in them."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Generally speaking, anyone can wear any style they want to. But you may want to avoid this chop if you have any cowlick along the front hairline, says Norris. Instead, work with a stylist to figure out what length works best for your hair type and face shape. While most stylists should know what a blunt bang is, bring a picture for a visual, just in case.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-style-blunt-bangs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Style Blunt Bangs</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">First, use a styling product like the <a href=# class=pseudoStyle data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Bb. Thickening Spray</a> as you blow-dry your bangs to set them in the right position. Also, blow-dry them downward and as soon as you towel-dry hair to make sure they retain their shape, says Fitzsimons.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To refresh your fringe between wash days, he recommends applying a dry shampoo, such as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Andrew Fitzsimons Discreet AF Dry Shampoo</a>, to soak up excess oil; for curly hair, meanwhile, moisturize them often with a lightweight curl cream to restore definition.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-maintain-blunt-bangs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Maintain Blunt Bangs</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The bad news: Blunt bangs do require more maintenance than other types of bangs. While softer curtain bangs can be pushed off the face if you don't love how they look at the moment or are waiting for them to grow out, you don't have that luxury with blunt bangs — so you'll have to stay on top of your regular bang trims, Norris says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ideally, you should get a bang trim every six weeks. In doing so, "it keeps them in incredible shape to style them and work with them," says Fitzsimons. For day-to-day maintenance, comb them throughout the day with a small comb and refresh them with a dusting of dry shampoo to keep them looking fresh, especially during the summer.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57waWsp6xdl66vs9Jmq6udnpl6eICYcGxucQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
