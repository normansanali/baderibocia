Russell took piano lessons and studied at Max Reinhardt's theatrical workshop in Los Angeles.</p><p>But Russell was just working as a receptionist in a chiropodist's office when she was discovered by movie producer Howard Hughes. He cast the 19-year-old in his controversial film, The Outlaw, and spared no expense in building up publicity for her.</p><p>He arranged pinup girl photoshoots, which were especially appreciated by the U.S. Navy. In a 1943 poll, the Navy even voted her as "the girl we'd like to have waiting for us in every port."</p><p>While some regarded these risqué pictures — which emphasized her chest — as vulgar publicity, Russell wasn't ashamed. That said, she wanted to prove there was more to her than her curves. However, she'd signed a seven-year deal with Hughes, and he mostly wanted her in films that showcased her body.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-302923 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/jane-russell-gold-outfit.jpg alt="Jane Russell" width=600 height=813 sizes="(max-width: 600px) 100vw, 600px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-302923 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>ullstein bild via Getty Images</span><span class=caption-body>A scene from the movie His Kind of Woman. 1951.</span></p><p>Though the public largely regarded Russell as a sex symbol, she eventually gained acclaim as an actress and singer as well. One of her most-remembered roles was 1953's Gentlemen Prefer Blondes, where she shared the screen with Marilyn Monroe.</p><p>Sadly, Russell's film career also saw its fair share of box-office bombs, and she later shifted her focus to television, stage performances, and nightclubs.</p><p>Even though Russell later became a born-again Christian, she believed that her prior status as a sex symbol didn't conflict with her faith. As she once <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">explained</a> to a curious interviewer, "Christians have bosoms, too, you know."</p><p>Outliving many other pinup girls, Jane Russell died of respiratory failure in 2011 at the age of 89.</p><p>While the golden age of pinup models has passed, that doesn't mean the art of the pinup has disappeared. Modern burlesque stars and even a few mainstream celebrities have taken pinup photos — or pinup-inspired photos — in recent years. And it's no secret that many stars continue to be inspired by pinup icons like Marilyn Monroe — a true testament to their legacy.</p><p>Now that you've learned all about history's most iconic pinup girls, check out the <a href=#>sexiest Broadway revue of the 1920s</a>.
