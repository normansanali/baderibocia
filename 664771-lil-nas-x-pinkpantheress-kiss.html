In the past year, he's <a href=# rel>explored his sexuality</a> and in January 2023 came out as "a little bisexual." He was also briefly the President of Riot Games to promote his track "Star Walkin'", which was written for the League of Legends World Championships. Oh and he also threw a house party that led to a $1 million lawsuit from his landlord.</p><p>Lil <a href=# class=text-word rel>Nas</a> X doesn't have much of a dating history, not when compared to a number of people we typically cover here at HotNewHipHop. However, rumors have recently circulated about a romantic connection between him and fellow musician Pinkpantheress. Pinkpantheress recently bagged her first major chart appearance featuring on <a href=# class=text-word rel>Ice Spice</a>'s "Boy's A Liar Pt. 2". This largely stems from a picture of the pair of them kissing. However, you can always count on Lil Nas X to a top-tier response to such an image.</p><span><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lil-nas-x-trolls-twitter-perfectly>Lil Nas X Trolls Twitter Perfectly</h2></span><p>The picture, posted by multiple accounts on Friday night, shows Pinkpantheress and Lil Nas X sharing a quick kiss. Users also posted other pictures from the night. This of course led to wild speculation across social media and gossip outlets. In fairness, it is very good evidence to link the two of them. They have been seen linking up a few times during 2023 already, going back as far as February. Nas posted a picture of the pair of them on February 28 to Instagram. However, the pair are yet to link up musically.</p><p>However, Lil Nas X had the full story, which he explained via his Twitter account. "she had food on her lip ! I was getting it off !" The response has been like 45,000 times since he posted it on Saturday morning. The comments are, of course, a mess. There's memes, jokes, support, and just a fun little splash of outright homophobia. Neither Lil Nas nor Pinkpantheress has outright confirmed that the pair are dating and Lil Nas' explanation is pretty convincing. Do you think they make a good couple? If they do confirm their relationship, be sure to check back at HotNewHipHop for all the details.</p><p>[<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">via</a>]</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvTp5ywoJmltbC8jZympmdma4F4g5Bmo6KkXaOutHnXZqeippulrq%2FAx56pnqujYriqv9I%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
