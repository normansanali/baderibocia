Kennedy Jr., 60, on August 2 in Hyannis Port, Mass., at the Kennedy family compound, reports Us Magazine.</p><p>The couple’s guest list included friends and former costars of Hines’, Larry David, Julia Louis-Dreyfus, Kevin Nealon, and Ed Begley Jr. While the bride wore an understated strapless, cocktail-length dress, Kennedy Jr., 60, wore the more traditional black suit to the 30-minute ceremony.</p><p>Hines has had to deal with recent reports of her fiance’s philandering, with specific women being named as current mistresses with details about his affairs in numerous tabloids and media outlets. Apparently the blushing bride either doesn’t believe the hype, or as her friends seem to believe, she simply turns a blind eye because of her desperate bid to officially become a Kennedy. Cheryl had played the “I will not marry a cheater” card and took off her engagement ring briefly <a rel=nofollow href=#>after learning of at least one of the reported affairs</a> as CDL reported. Likely after a few promises of ‘forever’ and unabated faithfulness by the habitual cheater, Cheryl fell hook, line, and sinker and moved forward with the wedding as planned.</p><p>Hines has one 10-year-old daughter and one prior marriage under her belt, while Kennedy Jr. brings two children under 18 into the marriage, along with four other adult children. This is his third marriage; his first ended in divorce, while his second wife committed suicide after what some say was the result of the long-suffering pain his wild ways put her through.</p><p>For now, Hines seems to be on cloud nine, but we have to wonder how many women he’s reportedly been dating recently will begin coming out of the woodworks now!</p><p>Tell us what you think! Will Cheryl be able to tame the known womanizer, or is this marriage doomed?</p><p>Photo Credit: FameFlynet</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaG1nk52ys8XLZp%2BippWoerO7wZ6prWWWYrimus2em7Jlmqd6rq3Rq6CenF2dxqK6zaKqZqifp8Fuw8Sdm6Kml2K9qbvTqKpo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
