Specifically, they have longed to uncover the story of his father, who abandoned him as a child, leaving Megumi in the care of Gojo. Curious about his past and his mysterious family ties, more and more fans requested his past to be introduced in the manga, and it was – via Megumi’s father. So who is he?</p><h2 id=h-who-is-megumi-s-dad data-injectable=false>Who is Megumi’s dad?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Toji-Fushiguro-e1659549097563.png><p data-characters=444 data-current-count=744 data-injectable=true>Although Megumi’s father, made a brief appearance in the<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> anime trailer for the upcoming season</a>, Toji Fushiguro had only been introduced in the manga until recently. In Gojo’s past arc, Toji is depicted as the notorious assassin known as the Sorcerer Killer, serving as the main antagonist. Previously associated with the Zenin family, Toji’s story sheds light on his life as a non-curse user, devoid of any cursed techniques.</p><p data-characters=400 data-current-count=400 data-injectable=true><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Similar to Maki</a> (in more ways than one), Toji is a non-curse user, lacking any innate talent for jujutsu. However, his incredible physical prowess surpasses that of his peers, earning him a reputation as one of the most formidable yet violent jujutsu practitioners of all time. Like Maki, he has honed his skills in weapon combat, skillfully merging his blades with his superhuman strength and speed.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wegotthiscovered.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/AAAABQAkfg4CZEKrHsLWwDcEouVv3eUnhCiT97OYWSuehI7R69GzIRrAgaePysvWmQC74HO37_O9HFDEHlAlmruHNaMrRABm.jpg><p data-characters=458 data-current-count=458 data-injectable=true>Toji’s personality, however, is far more different than many would expect. His vengeful and dangerous nature is the perfect result of his exclusion from the Zenin clan due to his lack of curse manipulation. His bitterness towards the jujutsu world led him down a path of violence, causing him to oppose and sabotage their efforts to eradicate curses, going as far as to battle against Gojo, knowing deep down, that he would stand no chance of winning.</p><p data-characters=432 data-current-count=432 data-injectable=true>After parting ways with the Zenin family, Toji married and took on his wife’s last name, “Fushiguro.” Together, they welcomed a child named Megumi into the world, but unfortunately, Toji recognized Megumi’s potential to become a powerful curse user. This led the fighter to make the decision to sell his own son to the Zenin family as their descendant, which led to Gojo adopting Megumi as his subordinate.</p><p data-characters=252 data-current-count=252 data-injectable=false>For now, we can expect to meet Toji on the screen at long last. In the end, he became a fan favorite not long after he first appeared, leaving fans longing for more of this mysterious yet arrogant character. After all, who doesn’t love a bad boy?</p><p data-characters=78 data-current-count=330 data-injectable=false>Jujutsu Kaisen season two will be available to watch on July 6 on Crunchyroll.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmeRo7ausY6wn6hlmah6rrHGrqSiq12ZrqV5yKdko62aqsG0wYykmKKrlaN8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
