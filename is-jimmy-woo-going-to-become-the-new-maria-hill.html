Recommended Videos Do you know what’s great about the MCU? It’s that even the side characters also have their moment under the spotlight. This meant that you might see some familiar faces, even if they were just the sidekick or a one-off character in one Marvel title, which just goes to show that these films are indeed connected.
One Marvel title where the side characters had a moment to shine was WandaVision, where side characters from Ant-Man and Thor joined forces in a Disney Plus show about a grieving Wanda Maximoff."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

While he is serious about his job, he did form a bond with Lang, especially when he went to his house over and over to make sure that he didn’t break his agreement. When Lang’s house arrest was over, he told Lang that he’ll be seeing him again soon if he does anything illegal.</p><p data-characters=340 data-current-count=340 data-injectable=false>This federal agent would later be involved in the Westview Anomaly, as he investigated the missing town’s case and stopped Tyler Hayward from using Vision as a sentient weapon and killing Wanda Maximoff. He once appeared in&nbsp;Ant-Man and the Wasp: Quantumania,&nbsp;but only for a brief moment, as he and Lang had lunch together in public.</p><p data-characters=360 data-current-count=700 data-injectable=false>It’s currently unknown if he’s going to play a larger role in the MCU. However, he is rumored to appear once again in the upcoming film <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Marvels</a>. Unlike Maria Hill, who has close ties with Nick Fury, Woo has ties with the&nbsp;Avengers. He may not be Fury’s deputy, but he can still save lives, even if he’s just an ordinary human being.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmedpMOqsdJooKxlmp66rsWMsKaoZZektq%2BzjK2mZpqVmLyusYytn55lnprEbrnAq6CaZZieua17</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
