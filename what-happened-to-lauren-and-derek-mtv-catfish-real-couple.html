The two chatted on MySpace and Lauren kept telling Nev and Max that she knew things would work out well. Everyone was skeptical since, of course, the show is known for featuring people hiding their real identities.What happened to Lauren and Derek? Let's take a look at this Catfish couple.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=lauren-and-derek-a-catfish-love-story>Lauren And Derek, A 'Catfish' Love Story</h2><p>After co-host Max Joseph left the show, <a href=#>many other co-hosts have appeared</a>, but there was something special about the dynamic between Max and Nev.</p><p>It was in an early episode when Max was still on the show that Lauren Meler tried to find her love interest, Derek Shullenbarger. The couple <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">got engaged during the season two reunion</a>.</p><p>According to Us Weekly, Nev Schulman said that he was aware that the big moment was going to happen. It turns out that Nev and Max paid for the ring. Nev said, "I did know it was coming, as did Max. Max and I bought Derek the engagement ring so that he could propose because he needed help paying for it. We went with him that morning and it was really sweet."</p><p><strong>Updated on March 02, 2022:</strong> Despite Lauren and Derek being considered a "real couple" on Catfish since Derek wasn't lying about who he was, the couple decided to break up, announcing their amicable split to fans in 2014, and whilst Lauren keeps a relatively low profile on social media, Derek has gotten married to someone else.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It's definitely sad to hear that the couple is no longer together and that they didn't get married after all.</p><p>In September 2013, Lauren shared in a tweet that she had gotten pregnant but sadly had a miscarriage. She wrote, "The 'update surprise': I was 10 wks pregnant, but we had a miscarriage Tuesday. Now that the secrets out, let's move on."</p><p>Nev shared that <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Lauren and Derek were going to stay friends</a> and that there was no bad blood about the split. Nev said, “I think it’s important to remember just because relationships come and go, and you might be in love with someone, and you think that they’re the one, take your time, there’s no reason to rush," according to The Cinemaholic.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">How Much Do Contestants On ‘The Challenge’ Get Paid?</a></span></p><h2 id=what-happened-to-lauren-and-derek-in-the-catfish-episode>What Happened To Lauren And Derek In The 'Catfish' Episode?</h2><p>The Cinemaholic explains that when the couple appeared in season two of Catfish, Derek was 23 and Lauren was 21. They had been talking for a period of eight years.</p><p>Lauren lived in Texas and there were some juicy details about her life that fans learned about. She was going to marry someone other than Derek, which put the pause on their online friendship, but that ended and she and Derek kept talking. Lauren was a single mother to her son, Mason.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static0.thethingsimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/Catfish-Lauren-And-Nev.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Fans of Catfish know that there are some common features of episodes. Nev and his co-host talk to the "hopeful" and ask about the relationship that they have with their online love interest. They ask for photos, social media accounts, text messages, emails, and any other information that could be helpful in the search.</p><p>It's common that the "catfish" doesn't want to video chat, and that's what happened with Derek and Lauren. Derek turned out to be real, which is what Lauren thought, and he was nervous about seeing Lauren IRL.</p><p>Things between the Catfish stars seemed perfect and wonderful, and in the video chat at the end of the episode, Lauren was going to relocate to Maryland so she could be with Derek.</p><p>Fans were thrilled to learn of their engagement, so it's definitely too bad that it didn't work out.</p><p><span class=related-single>RELATED: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Catfish: 10 Times Nev And Max Were Tricked">Catfish: 10 Times Nev And Max Were Tricked</a></span></p><h2 id=nev-s-perspective-of-catfish-has-changed>Nev's Perspective Of 'Catfish' Has Changed</h2><p>Fans of Catfish have seen Nev go through some big changes in his personal life. He's married to Laura Perlongo and the two share two kids, Cleo and Beau.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Nev told Hollywood Life that his perspective on the show is different now that he has become a husband and father.</p><p>“Now that I am responsible for a wife and children, the appreciation of what I do on the show both as a service to individuals but also as a job has really grown,” Nev explained. “As you get older, in all aspects of your life, you start to realize what is more important and what and where you place your value. I have been making the show for the last 10 years and there have been times that whether or not the show kept going or got renewed for a next season didn’t mean as much for me. I loved making it. I have never not wanted to but I had moments where I thought it was time to make something else."</p><p>While it's too bad that Lauren and Derek didn't work out after meeting up on Catfish, fans of the reality show are hopeful that others will find love on the series.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p><span class=next-single>NEXT: <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer" title="15 Little Known Details About MTV Catfishâs Nev Schulman">15 Little Known Details About MTV Catfish’s Nev Schulman</a></span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTErZ%2Bippeoe6S7zGiuoZmkYrWivM%2BepZ6cXam8brjArqmepl2Wu6V5w56pnqNdosG3ecKaq5%2Bho516s7HApWScp6WluaZ7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
