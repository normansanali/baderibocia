Bethenny Frankel insisted once again on Wednesday, September 7, that she’s never had plastic surgery.
The Real Housewives of New York City star, 45, was asked if she’s gone under the knife during Watch What Happens Live — and, in her response, explained why her jaw is looking noticeably smaller these days.
“I was wondering if you had any plastic surgery done lately?” a caller asked the Skinnygirl mogul."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The temporomandibular joint (TMJ) connects the jaw to the bones of the skull, and, if irritated, can cause pain. It could be treated with physical therapy, medications or bite guards.</p><span class=caption></span><p>“My face completely changed,” Frankel added of the apparently unintentional transformation.</p><p>Frankel went on to acknowledge that she did look a bit <a href=#>different at the recent <i>RHONY</i> reunion.</a> “I looked at the reunion and my eyes — the little trick that actually [makeup artist] Kristofer Buckle taught Maryana, my makeup artist, is when you put your eyelashes on, put the ends up a little bit, and it makes your eyes look a little more out. So they don’t go down,” she explained. “But, no, I have not. I have not had any plastic surgery.”</p><p>Back in May, Frankel similarly denied that she’s had plastic surgery during an interview with the <i>Daily Mail.</i> She did, however, admit to getting Botox on other places on her face besides her jaw. “I don’t do it religiously,” she said at the time. “Maybe once a year when I think of it, I’ll be like, ‘Oh, I look like a Shar-Pei, let me do that.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGabnaSdsq%2B62Gadq5meoLKtedOao6SrXaW5or%2FToppmq6WntKa%2B2Gacsaiclravv4yhnKtlo52%2FqrrKoqWgZZqWxG7Dk2xvbnFiZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
