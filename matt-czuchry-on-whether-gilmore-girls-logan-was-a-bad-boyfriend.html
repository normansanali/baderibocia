During a Tuesday, April 2, appearance on The Talk, Czuchry, 46, was asked to comment on a TikToker’s claims that Logan was inconsistent throughout his relationship with Rory Gilmore and that impacted many women’s real-life low relationship standards.
“We shouldn’t be searching for perfection in anything, whether it be in relationships or whatever it may be,” Czuchry said in a rebuttal."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

As Rory grew up, she dabbled in separate relationships with the likes of Dean (<strong>Jared Padalecki</strong>), Jess (<strong>Milo Ventimiglia</strong>) and Logan (Czuchry).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Does-Matt-Czuchry-Think-Gilmore-Girls-Logan-Lowered-Bar-for-Boyfriends.png><p class=p1>Devoted <i>Gilmore Girls </i>fans have since questioned whether Dean, Jess or Logan was Rory’s best boyfriend, often <a href=#>pointing out each guy’s downfalls</a>. The three actors, meanwhile, have declined to pick sides through the years.</p><p class=p1>“Everybody debates who’s best for Rory because they feel different about their strengths and weaknesses that might match up,” Czuchry stressed on Tuesday. “I think as long as we’re not shooting for perfection, then I’m OK with the take.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p class=p1>Czuchry, Ventimiglia, 46, and Padalecki, 41, all reprised their roles in <i>Gilmore Girls</i>’ 2016 Netflix revival, titled <i>A Year in the Life</i>, to different degrees. For Czuchry’s Logan, he was involved in an extramarital affair with Rory. The four-part series concluded with the reveal that Rory was pregnant, though it <a href=#>has never been confirmed</a> if it was Logan’s child.</p><p class=p1>“Amy and Dan, they told me who the father of the baby was, and they said, ‘Yeah, you can tell whoever you want.’ And I never have because one, that’s for them to say,” Czuchry <a href=#>exclusively told </a><i><a href=#>Us Weekly</a> </i>in January 2021. “Ultimately this is Amy and Dan’s show and it’s Lauren’s show and it’s Alexis’ show. It’s not mine. And so, for me, it doesn’t feel like the right place to say who it may or may not be.”</p><p class=p1>He continued: “Also if we do come back [for season 2 of <i>Year in the Life</i>], they may change their minds. So it could become somebody else. Those are the reasons why I’ve never said what they told me on set.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGS7psPSaKSarKRisLvBwqGpsmWfo3q4tMStn56qXZy2rbnOq5xmn5mnubR5y6iemqZdrK60ecBmmZqcXZe8urLRopynnF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
