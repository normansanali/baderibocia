We turn to Instagram to see what all of our favorite celebs are up to — but we’re also glued to our feeds for shopping inspo and the latest trends. Particularly during quarantine, Instagram has become our go-to source <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">for styling tips</a> — and we have influencers around the world to thank for that!</p><p>The main job of an Instagram fashion influencer (in addition to looking on point at all times) is to keep their fingers on the pulse of the style space. They post glamorous pictures, and then we come along and locate the items for you. A piece that’s been making waves is this <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">simple bodysuit from MANGOPOP</a>. It’s super basic, clean and affordable, so it’s only natural that so many mega-babes are snapping selfies wearing it!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/MANGOPOP-Womens-Mock-Turtle-Neck-Long-Sleeve-Bodysuit-Light-Heather-Grey.jpg><p>MANGOPOP Women’s Mock Turtle Neck Long Sleeve Bodysuit (Light Heather Grey)</p><p><strong>Get the </strong><span id=productTitle class="a-size-large product-title-word-break"><strong><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">MANGOPOP Women’s Mock Turtle Neck Long Sleeve Bodysuit</a> for prices starting at just <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener noreferrer">$10</a>, available at Amazon!
