Welcome to Tokyo
We finally met Chyna’s mom, Tokyo Toni, “the realest person” that the makeup maven knows. They decide Chyna will take Rob to Washington, D.C., to see Tokyo for their Fourth of July block party, then laugh that Rob probably doesn’t even know what a block party is."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

But at least they all got to visit the first strip club that Chyna ever danced at. Ah, memory lane.</p><p><b>Welcome to Tokyo</b></p><p>We finally met Chyna’s mom, <b>Tokyo Toni</b>, “the realest person” that the makeup maven knows. They decide Chyna will take Rob to Washington, D.C., to see Tokyo for their Fourth of July block party, then laugh that Rob probably doesn’t even know what a block party is. Chyna revealed that she hadn’t broken the news to her about her problems with Rob (a soft way of saying she hasn’t told her mom that she kicked her baby daddy out of the house multiple times, then was disappointed when he decided he wasn’t ready to move back in as soon as they made up), so we knew where this was going …</p><p><b>Chyna Is Real Too</b></p><p>In a fascinating scene, Chyna read Rob’s Postmates history to see what he’d been eating. He had broccoli and cheddar soup from Subway, two Kit Kat bars and six Whatchamacallits (which Chyna mysteriously hadn’t heard of).</p><p><b>Rob Might Be Sick Again</b></p><p>Rob admitted that he was feeling the symptoms he felt when he faced his scary diabetes diagnosis. Chyna, the supportive girlfriend she is, offered to take him to the hospital that very night instead of going to his sister <b>Khloé Kardashian</b>’s birthday party, but then told the cameras in her interview that she thinks it’s just nerves about the party. But if he wanted to go the hospital, she totally would have!</p><p>They made it to Khloé’s party, which <a href=#>we’d already seen on <i>KUWTK</i></a><i>.</i> Ready for new material now.</p><p><b>Chyna Upstages Khloé’s Party With a Better Shindig</b></p><p>Chyna threw a barbecue at her house after Khloé’s party so that Rob could continue to socialize. Chef Sean whipped up some magical-looking food that everyone ate while Chyna and <b>Scott Disick</b> tried to persuade Rob to take that D.C. trip. Scott asked the question everyone’s been wondering: Does Chyna know all 12 of her dad’s kids’ names? She does and named them all to prove it. Rob must’ve been as impressed as everyone else because he agreed to go to D.C.</p><p><b>Casual Family Dinner</b></p><p>Rob and Chyna made it to D.C. and went to dinner with Chyna’s mom and dad, Eric Sr. — putting the two of them in the same room for the first time in 10 or 12 years (depending on who you ask) — and three of Chyna’s half-siblings, Britney, Camille and Eric Jr., who Tokyo had never met. After a tense discussion about the nonexistent age difference between the three girls, the mood turned to laughter when Chyna revealed she’s never heard Rob fart, while Rob divulged that he’s never met anybody in his life who farts as much as Chyna does! Back in L.A., every female Kardashian and Jenner breathed a sigh of relief.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/themes/us-weekly/assets/img/us-placeholder.svg?quality=86&strip=all"><p><b>“Back at the Roots”</b></p><p>Chyna took Rob and her family to the gentleman’s club Sensationals, where Chyna got her stripping start. This is the happiest Rob has looked during the entire series thus far. When they left, Rob said he is going to donate 2,000 brand-new chairs to the club. Still waiting on confirmation that this actually happened.</p><p>Later, Chyna took Rob bowling, where he met more of Chyna’s siblings, and Chyna’s siblings met each other. Luckily, Rob is used to large families and still seemed fine.</p><p><b>Rob’s First Block Party</b></p><p>Tokyo threw the most fun-filled Fourth of July party ever, but the night was tarnished by Chyna’s L.A. BFF Paige and Sensationals BFF Treasure — battle of the BFFs. There can only be one.</p><p>Actually, there can be two. One commercial break later, they made up and Paige rubbed Treasure’s butt to prove it. Who knows where Rob was or who he was with during the spat, but later in the evening Rob and Chyna finally opened up to her mom about their issues. Tokyo emotionally told Rob they need to solve their problems because their problems are solvable, unlike the actual problems she faced when raising Chyna. The realest.</p><p>“You gotta stop what you’re doing, OK?” Tokyo warned the Arthur George sock designer. “You’re gonna ruin it.”</p><p>Rob seemed to actually listen, hopefully moving the story line next week away from Rob and Chyna’s problems and toward a cohesive parenting unit.</p><p>Tell<i> Us:</i> Was Tokyo right to lecture Rob?</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p><i>Rob & Chyna</i> airs on E!
