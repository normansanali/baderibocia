Nellie’s was inspired by her traditions of music and food that have since continued in the Jonas family.</p><p>Denise and Kevin Jonas, Sr., the parents of the Jonas Brothers, worked in partnership with TLI Bedrock LLC to open this new location at the MGM Grand, which has long had a relationship with the Jonas family, says Andrew Siegel of TLI Bedrock LLC.</p><p>“Kevin told me that MGM has long been a part of the Jonas family from back when their sons were young and first going on tours,” Siegel says.</p><p>The choice to go to Vegas was also solidified by the sheer number of visitors that come to the area from all over the world.</p><p>“Coming to the Strip gives us an opportunity like no other location to share Nellie’s story to visitors from all over through our unique hospitality, live entertainment and delicious, authentic Southern cooking,” Siegel adds.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7u7PRZ6WerF%2Bau3DDyKSgaK%2BYrnqlu4ytn55lmqS7or%2BMm6morJiav7R5x5qtnmWRYr%2Bmv9OarKuZnql6qrqMp5po</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
