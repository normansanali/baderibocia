The statistics are grim, but nestled within an industrial complex in Fenton, I discovered a glimmer of hope.</p><p>If someone wasn't looking for it, they might easily miss this gym. Once inside, visitors quickly realize it's much more than that.</p><p>This is a battleground where all the boxers are united in the same fight, not against each other or a rival gym, but against an elusive adversary: Parkinson's disease. This disorder of the central nervous system affects movement, often manifesting as tremors, a lack of balance, slow-motion movement, rigidity, and other symptoms that complicate daily life. Yet, this gym emerges as a beacon of hope.</p><p>Two years ago, I received a Parkinson's diagnosis. It was only after going public with my Parkinson's that I began to hear about Rock Steady Boxing. An overwhelming chorus of emails praised the program, urging me to join as soon as possible.</p><p>And so, I did. Observing a class, I felt confident, thinking, "I got this!" However, participating proved to be a humbling experience. The program's exercises are meticulously designed to target the specific needs of those with Parkinson's, but Rock Steady Boxing's impact extends far beyond physical workouts.</p><p>It's not just about fitness; it's about family. It's a community of fellow travelers on Parkinson's journey. This gym was founded on the needs of one man, supported by his family's love and dedication.</p><p>Terry LeGrand, who passed away five years ago in November, laid the foundation for this special gym, a legacy that continues to thrive today. I am profoundly grateful to be part of this community.</p><p>For anyone living with Parkinson's disease or knowing someone who is, there are several Rock Steady Boxing gyms in our area and many more across the country. You can find the nearest gym and more information about the program at rocksteadyboxing.org.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmien61%2Fr7vWZ5qopV%2BrtqWxzmhoa2WSlr%2B0ec6fZJygkae2tcWMrZiknaNiva2twp5kqKZdmbKkeZBwZnFpaG6Gd4SO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
