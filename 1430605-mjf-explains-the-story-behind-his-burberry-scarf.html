When asked about the story behind his Burberry scarf, Friedman shares the origins of why the scarf is part of his character.</p><p>“There was a 16 and under bar-like club, but it didn’t serve alcohol in Long Island,” MJF began. “I can’t remember the name of it. It was like Crazy Horse or something weird like that. And I went with my friends. It was the height of the summer, and obviously, all the girls are all over me, and that’s not hyperbole. It is what I what it is. I’m very good at getting with women.</p><p>“But there was one guy in particular, who I could see also had a line forming for him. And, of course, this agitates me because whenever the spotlights not on me, I get very agitated. And I look at this guy, again, height of summer, and this guy’s got on Gucci shoes, long black jeans, and a Burberry scarf…wool.</p><p>“It’s the summertime. It’s hot as balls, not just outside, but in this club. And I’m thinking to myself, you schmuck, the only reason you’re wearing that is so everybody in here knows you can afford it. And then I thought, hmm, and there you go.”</p><p>When asked if Burberry has ever reached out to offer some of their scarfs, MJF reveals they have never spoken.</p><p>“No, it’s really funny. I’ve never reached out, nor have they,” MJF said. “I think we’re at a standstill. We’ll see what happens. I think there’s a part of them that wants me to stop it. And there’s another part of them that wants me to keep going. Because I’ll tell you point blank, there were not 10,000 people entering an arena with a Burberry scarf on before MJF came into the scene.”</p><p><a href=#>MJF Responds To Cody Rhodes’ Statement That He Will Join WWE One Day</a></p><p>What do you make of MJF’s comments?
