And just yesterday, it was announced a sports pub is opening by what used to be the By George Inn,” said Bradley.</p><p>When the snow melts away and temperatures warm up, a new brewery will open its doors, as well as more events in Central Park.</p><p>“There’s a group called Inclined Development Group that has purchased several properties on Main Street. My understanding, there is going to be a brewery and a beer garden area. So that will be coming Spring or early Summer,” said Bradley.</p><p>“I also look forward to the warmer months when we can utilize Central Park because it’s a beautiful area. And there’s bands and people walking around,” said Bradley.</p><p>People in the area may notice the hard work that is going into these new businesses and changes downtown.</p><p>“We were joking in the chamber the other day we are seeing more and more dumpsters, and we actually think they are beautiful because it means work is being done and things are being renovated, and it’s just an exciting time,” said Bradley.</p><p>Visit the <a href=# title=https://www.crchamber.com/ class=themeColorForLinks>Cambria Regional Chamber of Commerce’s website</a> to learn more.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivmpawtcKNnKamZ56axLR7y6iamqRfqLK3sdGao2amlax6o8HSoqWeq6OawG7AzmaaqKWVYsGwecOorqesn6y7brbOoaWsrJ%2Bsu4C21qymrqqTmoqkuA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
