At 15, following an involvement in a school fight, he commenced training in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.</p><p>By 17, he was dedicated enough to make trips to Marcelo Garcia’s academy in New York, eventually relocating there at 19 to pursue a career in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.</p><p>From Parsippany–Troy Hills to the grand stages where he now competes, Danis has traversed a journey full of challenges and achievements.</p><p><strong>Also read:</strong> <a href=# rel=noopener>Jason Pethers Wikipedia And Age: How Old Is He?</a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmispqi1sMPSrZirq16YvK57w6KjpaeeYrGiusisZKudnJ60qrvNZpqarJikuaqvjJ6roaaZmLa1xYyoqaKfmaN8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
