While he hasn't had a major hit in some time, the musician still expresses his opinions about politics and basically everything else whenever he gets the chance.</p><p>While he has said plenty of stuff that offended some people, one of the comments that many found most upsetting came in 2015, when he weighed in with his feelings about <a href=#>Beyoncé</a> and the tremendous success she had already experienced in her career at the time. Now, almost a decade later, some fans are revisiting those controversial remarks.</p><figure class="sc-ksluoS jnYGUA"><span>Source: Getty Images</span></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">What were Kid Rock's comments about Beyoncé?</h2><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Rolling Stone</a>, Kid Rock weighed in on Beyoncé's success, saying that he didn't totally understand why she was so successful.</p><p>“Beyoncé, to me, doesn’t have a f--king 'Purple Rain,' but she’s the biggest thing on earth,” he said a the time. “How can you be that big without at least one ‘Sweet Home Alabama’ or ‘Old Time Rock & Roll’?”</p><p>The musician continued, adding that he didn't really understand her sexual appeal.</p><p>“People are like, ‘Beyoncé’s hot. Got a nice f--king a--,’” he continued. “I’m like, ‘Cool, I like skinny white chicks with big tits.’ Doesn’t really f--king do much for me.”</p><p>While Kid Rock seems to be willing to acknowledge differences in taste when it comes to who people are attracted to, he doesn't extend the same courtesy to differences in musical taste.</p><p>While his opinion of Queen Bee's output may be that she doesn't have a single defining song, there are plenty of die-hard Beyoncé fans who swear by at least one of her biggest hits, which include "Single Ladies" and "Irreplaceable."</p><p>Kid Rock doesn't really seem to be all that interested in debating the nuances of Beyoncé's discography, though.</p><figure class="sc-bYwzba cYmwOA"><a href=# style=background:#fff;line-height:0;padding:0;text-align:center;text-decoration:none;width:100%>View this post on Instagram</a><p style="color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;line-height:17px;margin-bottom:0;margin-top:8px;overflow:hidden;padding:8px 0 7px;text-align:center;text-overflow:ellipsis;white-space:nowrap"><a href=# style=color:#c9c8cd;font-family:Arial,sans-serif;font-size:14px;font-style:normal;font-weight:400;line-height:17px;text-decoration:none>A post shared by Kid Rock (@kidrock)</a></p></figure><h2 data-header=true class="sc-bTJPMs hHQrGE">Kid Rock doubled down on his comments after the interview went live.</h2><p>This was probably predictable, but Kid Rock didn't back away from his comments after the interview went live, even though they caused a firestorm. Fans were upset about his dismissal of Beyoncé's music and because of how he reduced one of the most successful women in pop music to her looks.</p><p>In response to that hubbub, Kid Rock simply posted an image of a can of Raid, meaning that he was going to go after the Beyhive.</p><p>Kid Rock's comments were certainly upsetting to those who love Beyoncé's music, but the overlap between Kid Rock and Beyoncé fans is likely pretty minimal, even if there are tons of people who love Beyoncé.</p><p>Following her latest album, "Cowboy Carter," Beyoncé is engaging more with the world of country music, which is where she comes from, than she has at any other point in her career.</p><p>Country music has long been a genre filled with tension between progress and racism, and Kid Rock embodies that tension. Of course, at this point in their respective careers, Beyoncé has lapped Kid Rock several hundred times.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pbXSramam6Ses7p6wqikaKhfoLaledGomqRlkprGsLrCnmScp52isq%2FA</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
