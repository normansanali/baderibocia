The </span><i><span>Top Gun </span></i><span>actress chose to live largely out of the spotlight over the past few years. She has stepped out for only a few rare outings amid her break from Hollywood.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Prior to taking a step back from acting, Meg appeared in a number of blockbuster films and hit television series, including </span><i><span>Sleepless in Seattle</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>When a Man Loves a Woman, City of Angels </span></i><span>and more. Her most recent acting roles came in 2015, with appearances in </span><i><span>Fan Girl</span></i><span>, </span><i><span>Ithaca</span></i><span> and </span><i><span>Picture Paris</span></i><span>. In 2020, the Connecticut native narrated the “Cut and Run” podcast series.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Meg opened up about the reason why she decided to take a step back from her Hollywood career in recent years.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“I wasn’t as curious about acting as I was about other things that life can give you. I wanted to live more,” the beauty told </span><a href=#><i><span>The New York Times Magazine</span></i></a><span> in February 2019.</span></p><p><span>She continued, “I don’t feel like, naturally, I’m a performer,” adding, “I knew I was being given opportunities and that there was certain music I could play as an actor. Certain things I could do. And I liked acting. I thought it was fun. But acting was a situation I was navigating.”</span></p><p><span>In May 2022, Meg announced she was set to make her long-awaited Hollywood return in the film </span><i><span>What Happens Later</span></i><span>. She signed on to direct and star in the movie next to </span><a href=#><b>David Duchovny</b></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>“It is exciting to have Meg Ryan bring the weight of her experience in the genre to the director’s chair and to matchmake her with such a wonderful sparring partner in David Duchovny,” </span><b>Gabrielle Stewart</b><span> of distributor HanWay Films said in a statement to </span><a href=#><i><span>Variety</span></i></a><span>.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>One year later, the film was in post-production. As fans were eager to learn more about the upcoming romantic comedy, the </span><i><span>As the World Turns</span></i><span> alum stepped out for a public appearance in May 2023.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>Meg recently joined</span><a href=#><b> Michael J.
