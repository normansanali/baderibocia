He posted a series of pictures of one of his brothers and a long statement related to the death of his brother. He wrote, “It breaks my heart beyond measure to say that my beloved brother Charles has left us.”</p><p>Darren added, “His loss leaves behind a debilitating fracture in the lives of his mother, his brother, his three small children, and their respective mothers.” He shared about his own struggle to wrap his head around his brother’s death which he would suspect be doing for the rest of his life.</p><p>Then he went on to add that his brother was lovable because of his goofy and silly nature. Charles was Darren’s “ready-made best friend” and they were inseparable. Growing up they shared a love of music and he was a raw talent as an artist.</p><p>Darren shared that his brother “struggled to find stability during an unfortunate rough patch in his life”.</p><p>“Despite our very vocal concerns about his well-being, and his protestations that everything was fine, it’s crushing to say now that Chuck clearly had had a severe depression welling up in him for some time,” he shared. “A depression that was only outmatched by his all-too-incredible ability to conceal it. Not just from the world at large, but most tragically, from the people who were closest to him.”</p><p>The singer shared about being oblivious about his brother’s war within himself. Then he shared the cause of Charles’s death to be suicide. Darren also added, “And while I can’t say my brother was “sick” per se, it is a fact that he was unwell, and somewhere along the line, his condition somehow blocked him from trying to help himself, despite our encouragement. This illness worsened, and he fell”.</p><p>“While it was a lapse in Chuck’s mental wellness that took him, it is simply not something that can define who he was,” Darren wrote of his brother. “All of the wonderful, inspiring, positive things about his life far outshine the circumstances by which it came to an end.”</p><p>He added, “He was a good man with a good heart who contributed enormous amounts of laughter, music, and joy to the world. And for the ones who were lucky enough to take part in those wonderful moments, it’s marvelous to know that those memories are plentiful, everlasting, and can never be taken away.”</p><h3><strong>Charles Criss Wife: Was He Ever Married?</strong></h3><p>Based on a few activities on social media, Charles Criss was in a relationship with his wife/girlfriend Angela who was known as “Rio” (Twitter: <a href=#>@starlet_rio</a>) whose Instagram account has been deleted as of this writing (<a href=#>@starlet_rio</a>).</p><p>On Twitter in November 2021, Angela had tweeted, “<span class="css-901oao css-16my406 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-qvutc0">So proud of you </span><span class=r-18u37iz><a class="css-4rbku5 css-18t94o4 css-901oao css-16my406 r-1cvl2hr r-1loqt21 r-poiln3 r-bcqeeo r-1ny4l3l r-1ddef8g r-tjvw6i r-qvutc0" dir=ltr role=link href=#>@ChuckCriss</a>“. </span>She is on Posh Mark and goes by the name (<a href=#>@hausofrio</a>).
