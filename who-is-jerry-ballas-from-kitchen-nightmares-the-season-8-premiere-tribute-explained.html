According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Branch Funeral Home</a>, Jerry lost his battle with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Ewing Sarcoma</a> – a rare type of cancer that occurs in bones or in the soft tissue around the bones. He was just 18 years old. According to Jerry’s parents:</p><p>“Tess and I do not like flowers so please do not send any. Instead please donate to these 2 charities below, they are both working for a cure for the exact cancer Jerry had. When Jerry was diagnosed in April of 2021, he said ‘If everyone paid this much attention to cancer as they did covid we would have a cure for cancer right now.’ Please pay ATTENTION, donate as much and as frequently as you can to:<br><a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Little Warrior Foundation</a> and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Wings For Ewing Sarcoma</a>.”</p><p>Our hearts go out to Jerry’s family, and we hope they can find strength in this difficult time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmekq3y4tM5moKxlmpq%2Fs8WMm5ilpJGoeqe%2BzqZkpKGkmLWmuoynoKCgpKKus7HSZquhnV2osqK%2FzqdkcWWgp7KutcSrnGasop6vtsDEZpyxqJyWtq%2Bxw2g%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
