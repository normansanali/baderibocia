While he doesn’t have a huge acting career, he appeared in a few comedies, most notably 2014’s <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Interview</a>, so he does have the potential to star in another.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/166b1ms/they_should_cast_eminem_for_enel_in_op_live_action/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3</figure><p data-characters=274 data-current-count=574 data-injectable=true>For those who don’t know who this character is, Enel is the former tyrannical ruler of Skypiea. He was the main antagonist of the Sky Island arc, which is the 13th story in the One Piece series, so it’s going to be a while before we see this character on screen.</p><p data-characters=417 data-current-count=417 data-injectable=true>Even if the Sky Island arc does receive an adaptation, fans pointed out that Eminem would be too old to play the character. As of writing, he is 50 years old. If it takes a year or two to produce a season, he’s going to be around 60. However, some argued that this age issue could be combated with CGI, like how<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Disney de-aged Mark Hamil</a> to look like his younger Luke Skywalker self in <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">The Mandalorian</a> season 2.</p><p data-characters=582 data-current-count=582 data-injectable=true>Others pointed to feasibility issues when it comes to casting the Rap God to play a Skypiea’s God. One joke is how casting Eminem would drain Netflix’s budget, especially since he has a reported net worth of $250 million. Meanwhile, some pointed out that he only does cameos, not major acting roles.<br>While it would be cool to have him cast in a future One Piece season, it might be difficult to get him on board. However, if the Rap God doesn’t want to play this anime character, a fan mentioned another candidate who might be perfect for the role — <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Vin Diesel</a>.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-reddit wp-block-embed-reddit" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>https://www.reddit.com/r/OnePiece/comments/166b1ms/comment/jyku6rb/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3</figure><p data-characters=372 data-current-count=672 data-injectable=true>Not only does he have the body for the role, but he also has an extensive acting history. At the same time, the guy can do his own stunts. The <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Fast X</a> actor told <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Metro</a> in 2021 that he used to be a “daredevil,” but becoming a father made him more cautious when doing stunt work.
