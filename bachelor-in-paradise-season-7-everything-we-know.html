Postponed last season due to the pandemic, the series brings back sizzling summer nights for the first time in two years,” the network said in a press release.</p><p>While ABC didn’t announce the series until April, Bachelor Nation was already making connections off screen, <a href=#>according to season 6 alum <strong>Blake Horstmann</strong></a>.</p><p>“Everybody’s talking to everybody already. And I’m like, ‘Have you guys learned nothing for me?’” Blake, who made headlines for his pre-show hookups ahead of the 2019 season, said on<a href=#> Us‘ “Here for the Right Reasons” podcast</a> in March. “I’m like, ‘God, you idiots, just f—king wait six months and then you won’t have to deal with that.’”</p><p><a href=#><strong>Jade Roper,</strong></a> who met husband <a href=#><strong>Tanner Tolbert</strong></a> on season 2 of Bachelor in Paradise, meanwhile, told Us that the <a href=#>spinoff has changed the rules when it comes to pre-show romances.</a></p><p>“We were discouraged to meet each other or talk to each other before we went on the show because they wanted the onscreen time to be the first time anybody met, and they could see that,” Jade said on “Here for the Right Reasons” in April. “But nowadays, everyone hangs out with each other. It’s so different. But I loved Paradise because of the quality time you got with people. I spent more time with Tanner in two days than I did with <a href=#><strong>Chris Soules</strong></a> in seven weeks, you know?”</p><p><strong>Us editors discuss Colton Underwood’s coming out in this Here for the Right Reasons podcast highlight!<strong><br></strong></strong></p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>While fans know BiP is returning, <a href=#><strong>Chris Harrison</strong></a> not will be part of the upcoming season. After the host apologized for his defense of controversial Bachelor season 25 contestant <a href=#><strong>Rachael Kirkconnell</strong></a>’s past racially insensitive actions in February, he subsequently stepped back from the After the Final Rose special. The network later announced <strong><a href=#>Kaitlyn Bristowe </a></strong>and<a href=#><strong> Tayshia Adams</strong> would lend a hand for season 17 of The Bachelorette</a>, which stars<a href=#><strong> Katie Thurston</strong></a> and returns in June.</p><p>A source told Us in April that the crew expects Harrison to be back in the future, but they don’t know anything for sure. Two months later, Us reported that he wouldn’t be in Mexico during the summer of 2021.
