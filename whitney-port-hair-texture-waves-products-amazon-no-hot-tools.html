We need to use hot tools like hair dryers, flat irons and curlers to leave it looking fabulous — but those hot tools are the exact reason it’s damaged, frizzy and out of whack!</p><p>Thankfully, we live in a world where there are products out there that can get us that same gorgeous texture, leaving it looking hot with the heat. But which ones? Thankfully, <strong>Whitney Port</strong> is letting us all in on her not-so-secret routine, posting a video on Instagram called “How To Get The Prettiest Natural Hair Texture With NO Hot Tools.” She wrote in her caption, “As promised, here is my trick to achieving natural hair texture with NO hot tools! This is SO easy and quick. Doing my hair has never been my strong suit….this is a great solution that makes me feel put together in no time.”</p><p>So there you have it — no hot tools and no professional hair-styling talent, a.k.a. we can all do this!

These sulfate-free formulas are the way to go. Port wrote, “While conditioner is in hair, run fingers through hair to get out knots,” explaining that you won’t be needing a brush at any point during this process!</p><p><strong>Get the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer sponsored">Enjoy Luxury Shampoo and Conditioner Duo</a> (originally $85) for just $80 at Amazon!
