If you want to produce it with me, I would love that; but you should be the producer and you should make all the g*****n money." The installment, which is set to premiere on September 7, wasn't an easy journey into the past for Lewinsky. "It's been really, really complicated... And as hard as it might have been for us, it was harder for her," co-producer Brad Simpson said to THR.</p><p dir=ltr>Nevertheless, Lewinsky has been committed to ensuring that her story is told authentically, even if that means including difficult scenes. She insisted that a scene of her flashing her thong at Clinton get written into the script, telling THR, "Listen, I would've loved to have been really selfish... Ultimately, I felt two things: One was that I shouldn't get a pass because I'm a producer; and two, that it was unfair to the team and to the project because it would leave everybody vulnerable."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7XCpKCsr5mbwW%2BvzqZmbnBoboB2e9ahmK1lnaS7qq%2FAZqOer5mjwKzFjJ2mnqtdm7yzecBmo6KumaO0brrOsGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
