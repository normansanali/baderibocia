In an interview with <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Deadline</a>, the Oscar-nominated actor said that he never expected to be in a 20-year relationship with his character and that his time in Kingdom Hearts was the longest project he has ever been in.</p><p>“I never could have expect at the time I could have been a 20-year relationship with a character.

He also has experience voice acting in animated films such as Disney’s&nbsp;The Hunchback of Notre Dame II&nbsp;and&nbsp;The Jungle Book 2.</p><p data-characters=143 data-current-count=387 data-injectable=false>What led Osment to give video game voice acting a shot was that he was given the opportunity to take on the role, and wanted to see how it went</p><p>“I think it was just an offer that came to my agent at the time. And it’s funny because it was an unusual project and we took the job going ‘Okay, we’ll see how it goes.’… As much as I love video games, I was not familiar with the sort of trajectory that would come out of a game like this and it became a really rewarding experience”</p><p data-characters=341 data-current-count=341 data-injectable=false>Osment also spoke about the responsibility he has due to his 20-year commitment to the Kingdom Hearts franchise, especially to the fans. He said that he needs to be able to take off that character and make sure it doesn’t go down a route that no one likes, while also praising the game’s mainstream appeal despite its dense lore.</p><p>“It makes me feel really good. I’m really glad because I know in my experience of video games, having a good times come from it. This is something that people play with their friends and getting involved with the lore in the story – it makes me happy that people enjoy it so much.”</p><p data-characters=301 data-current-count=301 data-injectable=false>To celebrate the game’s milestone anniversary, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Square Enix</a> <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">released a trailer for <strong>Kingdom Hearts IV</strong></a>, confirming the long awaited sequel’s development.
