It was amazing,” she told OK! Magazine about the engagement.</p><p>The I’m a Celebrity … Get Me Out of Here! alum made her relationship with the <a href=#>Love Island</a> alum Instagram official in July 2020.</p><p>The mother of five previously revealed that she was looking forward to having more children with Woods.</p><p>“I’m trying [to conceive another],” the Celebrity Big Brother U.K. alum exclusively told Us Weekly in January. “<a href=#>I want more kids</a>. As many as my body allows. Don’t sweat that.”</p><p>Price welcomed her eldest son, Harvey, 18, who suffers from septo-optic dysplasia, partial blindness, Prader-Willi syndrome and autism, with <a href=#><strong>Dwight Yorke</strong></a> in 2002.
