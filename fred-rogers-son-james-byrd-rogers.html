Because of this, he has continued to lead a very private life with hardly so much information about him in the public domain. Nonetheless, here is all we have gathered about him.</p><h3><b>Summary of James Byrd Rogers’s Bio</b></h3><ul><li><b>Full name: </b>James Byrd Rogers</li><li><b>Nickname: </b>Jim, Jamie</li><li><b>Gender:</b> Male</li><li><b>Date of birth:&nbsp;</b>1959</li><li><b><b>James Byrd Rogers’s Age:</b></b> 64 years old</li><li><b>Nationality:</b> American</li><li><b>Sexual Orientation:&nbsp;</b>Straight</li><li><b>Religion:&nbsp;</b>Christianity</li><li><b>Marital Status:</b> Married</li><li><strong>Wife:</strong> Margaret G. Rogers</li><li><b>James Byrd Rogers’s Children: </b>Alexander Rogers, Douglas Rogers</li><li><b>James Byrd Rogers’s Parents:</b> Fred Rogers (Father), Joanne Byrd Rogers (Mother)</li><li><b>Siblings: </b>John Rogers</li><li><b>Famous for: </b>Being the son of Fred Rogers</li></ul><h2><strong>James Byrd Rogers Grew Up Together with His Bother In A Christian Home</strong></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/buzzsouthafrica.com/us/wp-content/uploads/sites/4/2023/04/James-Byrd-Rogers--e1681636044675.png><p>James Byrd Rogers was born in 1959 in the United States to his parents, Fred Rogers and Joanne Rogers. He was also raised in the U.S together with his younger brother, John Rogers in a Christian family.</p><p>At the time of his birth, James’ parents were already married for five years. The marriage between his parents was very much different from that of many other celebrities who only marry for a short while before they divorce. Fred and Joanne remained together from 1952 when they got married until 2003 when the celebrated minister died. The fifty-one-year long marriage of his parents began after they first met during a Florida vacation.</p><p>James’ childhood was mostly fashioned by his parents, both of whom are devoted Christians. His father, Fred McFeely Rogers, was among many other things, a Presbyterian minister who many considered to have lived a saintly life until his death due to stomach cancer.</p><p>Fred dedicated his life to working on Children’s TV and this earned him many awards, over 40 honorary degrees, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom in 2002. It also served as a foundation upon which James and his younger brother, John, were raised.</p><h2><strong>James Byrd Rogers’ Childhood Was A Rather Rebellious One</strong></h2><p>James, who is also referred to as Jim or Jamie was from a stable home but that was not enough to keep him grounded. Consequently, when he was a teenager, he became<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external> rebellious.</a> He was sent to Rollins College in Florida in the 1970s, and during his freshman year, he shunned his parents almost completely.</p><p>He would never write to them or even reply when they called. But his parents decided to allow him to do some of those things <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>because they believe</a>d if they refused to allow him, he might go off and never return to his “nest” ever again.</p><p>Fred and Joanne described the period that their son stopped communicating with them and started his rebellious ways as a very tough time for the family. Nonetheless, it has been reported that they tried to always maintain a welcoming atmosphere for him and all others who visited, which was believed to be one of the things that saw the family through.</p><h2><strong>He is Not in the Entertainment Business like His Parents</strong></h2><p>Jim was raised by parents that made a name for themselves in the entertainment circles. While his father, as stated earlier, was a TV host, author, and producer among other things, his mother was a pianist who apart from raising her two sons, still managed to build a career for herself in music. She was in many concerts for more than 30 years.</p><p>One would expect that being raised in a home like that would influence James to also have a career in the entertainment business, but that is not the case. When he was a little child, Jim Rogers made his first appearance as an actor in the TV series, MisteRogers in which he portrayed himself. Between 1968 and 1990, he appeared in 7 episodes of Mister Rogers’ Neighborhood where he also portrayed himself, but this time as an adult. All these did not make him follow in the footsteps of his legendary father.</p><p>That said, while it is clear that he did not get into the entertainment life, the life he chose for himself has remained hidden as has has now drawn himself away from the public life, keeping all details of his personal dealings private.</p><h2><strong>James Byrd Rogers Now Lives A Very Quiet Life With His Family</strong></h2><p>Following his many years of absence from the public domain, many people have continued to wonder where Jim might be. According to a 2018 article, James has built a life for himself in Pittsburgh where he was raised. It was reported that he lived very close to his mother together with his wife whose name is Margaret G. Rogers.</p><p>The couple is blessed with two sons, the first of whom is Alexander Rogers who made an appearance on Mister Roger’s Neighborhood in 1990 together with his father and famous grandfather. Alex is now an adult and he has since married the love of his life, Caitlin E. Rogers and they live in Gibsonia, Pennsylvania.</p><p>The second son of Jim is Douglas G. Rogers. Unlike his brother, not so much is known about him. The little that is known is that he also lives in Gibsonia, Pennsylvania.</p><p>In 2018, James Byrd Rogers made an appearance in a documentary about his father, Won’t You Be My Neighbor, in which he appeared as himself. Speaking about the documentary, <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>he opined that</a> he was sure his father would wonder what the fuss was all about if he saw that a production was being done about him, but he might also lean back and reflect on the job he did.</p><p>His brother, John, on the other hand, had also stayed away from public life until 2020 when he <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow external noreferrer" data-wpel-link=external>made headlines</a> for the wrong reasons. He was accused of aggravated battery and <a href=# data-wpel-link=internal>domestic violence</a> against his former wife, Mary. It was claimed that he and his wife divorced in 2002 when she was still pregnant.</p><p>Neither James nor John seems to be involved in the Fred M. Rogers Center for Early Learning and Children’s Media, a nonprofit body founded to honor the memory of Fred Rogers. Jim doesn’t also seem to be involved in The Fred Rogers Company which was founded by his father.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiapa%2FHtLvUrZ%2BanqKesKJ6wqikaK2jZLOzscNmqaiflafAbr%2FOp2SjmZ2awG6u2KubZqqfnLKzv44%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
