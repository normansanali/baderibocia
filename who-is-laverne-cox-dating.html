Her role as Sophia Burset made her the first transgender person to be nominated for a&nbsp;Primetime Emmy Award&nbsp;in an acting category. She has worked as an advocate for the transgender community, protesting rights and spreading awareness about transgender culture. Moreover, Cox made history as the first transgender person to be featured on the cover of&nbsp;Time&nbsp;magazine and tirelessly continues her progressive work in the fight for gender equality.</p><p data-characters=757 data-current-count=757 data-injectable=true>Laverne Cox, 49, appeared as a contestant on VH1’s reality show I Want to Work for Diddy. From then on, she starred in TRANSform Me, which made her the first African-American transgender person to produce and star in her own TV show. In 2013, she began her recurring role on Netflix’s Orange is the New Black as a transgender woman incarcerated for credit card fraud. Cox <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">described Sophia</a> as “a multi-dimensional character who the audience can really empathize with” and clarified that “all of the sudden they’re empathizing with a real Trans person. And for Trans folks out there, who need to see representations of people who are like them and of their experiences, that’s when it becomes really important.”</p><h3 class="has-luminous-vivid-orange-color has-text-color" data-injectable=false>Who is Laverne Cox dating?</h3><p data-characters=286 data-current-count=286 data-injectable=false>In January 2022, Cox appeared on The Ellen DeGeneres Show and publicly disclosed that she has been in a relationship since the end of 2021.
