Living their lives by a code known as bushidō, loyalty and honor were core tenets of the samurai lifestyle. That sense of honor followed a samurai throughout his life — and even, in some instances, his death. When facing defeat, for example, a samurai might commit seppuku, also known as harakiri, a form of ritual suicide done by slitting one’s own belly horizontally with a blade.</p><p>Although the exact origins of this rather grisly act are unclear, seppuku likely originated in the late 12th century with one warrior by the name of Minamoto no Yoshitsune. Over the following centuries, seppuku started to evolve into something else, however. In the Warring States period, it allowed leaders to save the lives of their retainers. Then, during the more peaceful Edo period, it became a ritualized form of capital punishment — a way for a disgraced samurai to regain his honor.</p><p>Additional customs became attached to seppuku, including wearing a white kimono, writing a death poem, and the introduction of a “kaishakunin,” who would behead the condemned after disembowelment. Seppuku, conceptually, influenced the concept of honor in Japanese culture, but, at the same time, the changes in Japanese culture over the centuries influenced seppuku, as if the two existed in an evolving symbiotic relationship.</p><i class="fa fa-times"></i> <span class=caption-body>In accordance with the Bushido code, which held honor above all else, a samurai would perform seppuku to avoid capture or as punishment for breaking this sacred code.<p>In this illustration, a warrior prepares himself to perform seppuku, 1850.</p></span><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span> <span class=caption-body>The earliest written cases of actual seppuku being performed were in the story of the 1156 Hōgen Rebellion.

According to <a href=# rel=noopener>Nippon.com</a>, the first instance of seppuku allegedly dates back to 988 C.E., when a bandit by the name of Hakamadare was said to have slashed open his stomach after being caught. However, there is no real evidence that Hakamadare actually did this, and since he was a thief and not a samurai, it would be somewhat untruthful to say his death marked the beginning of seppuku.</p><p>Rather, University of Tokyo professor Yamamoto Hirofumi suggests seppuku's true origins came about a century later, in 1189. Following the Genpei War — a final struggle in Japan between the Taira and Minamoto clans, ending with the Minamoto's establishment of the Kamakura shogunate — Minamoto no Yoshitsune was facing defeat, with no option to retreat. Not willing to surrender himself to the forces that overwhelmed him, Minamoto chose to take his own life, plunging a knife into his stomach and slicing it open. His death was seen as an honorable way to die, a death that wiped away the dishonor of defeat.</p><p>Dying in battle was courageous, but running away was seen as a coward's option. By taking one's own life, a samurai was making a final, painful choice about how he died. Seppuku embodied the bushidō code of honor, courage, and self-sacrifice, and this grisly practice continued to be seen in such a manner through the medieval era. However, during the Warring States period (1467 to 1568), it would change.</p><h2>How Seppuku Changed During The Warring States Period</h2><p>The Warring States period — or the Sengoku period — was a time in Japanese history plagued by almost continual civil wars throughout the 15th and 16th centuries. Feudal lords turned on each other and the emperor, each vying to control Japan. Vassals turned on their lords, hoping to come into power of their own. It was a time of political chaos and mass social unrest.</p><img fetchpriority=high decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-495504 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/warring-states-ukiyo-e.png alt="Warring States Ukiyo E" width=900 height=457 sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p id=caption-attachment-495504 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>An ukiyo-e print depicting a battle during the Warring States period.</span></p><p>Given the tumultuous nature of the times, the life of a samurai was a busy, violent one. But the samurai code had not changed, and an honorable death was still sought after. But something had changed. Seppuku was no longer just a means for a warrior to retain his honor in death; it started being seen as a way for a military leader to save the lives of his retainers.</p><p>One of the most famous examples of this sacrificial seppuku occurred in June 1582. Hashiba Hideyoshi's forces sieged the castle of Shimizu Muneharu, intentionally diverting a river to flood the castle. Muneharu, realizing defeat was imminent, struck a deal of sorts with Hideyoshi: if Muneharu would commit seppuku, no one else would be killed.</p><p>Muneharu boarded a small boat and sailed out of the flooded castle. There, in the middle of the water, he plunged a knife into his stomach, and his people were spared.</p><p>His sacrifice was seen as a noble one, and it was slowly adopted by other military leaders who would sacrifice their own lives to protect their people.</p><p>This turbulent, war-torn period eventually came to an end, however. Once the conflict was over, a period of peace was ushered in, and with it, a new evolution of seppuku.</p><h2>Seppuku As Capital Punishment During The Edo Period</h2><p>Until now, seppuku had been a voluntary act, an honorable way out for samurai in dire situations. However, now that Japan's constant infighting had come to an end, the role of samurai in society began to change as well. Rather than serving as a military force, samurai instead took roles as civil servants, teachers, clerks, and bureaucrats in the Tokugawa shogunate.</p><p>But they were still bound by a code, and with that came certain expectations of how they should behave. As such, there needed to be punishment for any samurai who broke his code — and seppuku was as fitting a punishment as any.</p><img decoding=async aria-describedby=caption-attachment-495527 alt="Ukiyo E Print Of Japans Shipping Industry" width=900 height=457 data-sizes="(max-width: 900px) 100vw, 900px" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/allthatsinteresting.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/06/ukiyo-e-print-of-japans-shipping-industry.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p id=caption-attachment-495527 class=wp-caption-text><span class=credit>Wikimedia Commons</span><span class=caption-body>An ukiyo-e print of Osaka's shipping industry during the Edo period.</span></p><p>The biggest change during the Edo period, however, was that seppuku was no longer a voluntary act. It was a forced form of execution, ordered by the shogunate for any samurai who violated laws or feudal codes. Dishonorable acts or offenses brought shame not just on the samurai who committed them, but also upon his lord. Seppuku, as always, was seen as a way for the samurai to restore his honor.</p><p>During this period, other elements of the ritual evolved, too. Someone forced to commit seppuku would do so publicly, dressed in a white kimono. They were to face their death with dignity and stoicism in hopes of restoring their honor, and once the deed was done, a kaishakunin would step forward and behead the newly atoned samurai — though, notably, they would not remove the head completely.</p><p>Seppuku was essentially the most extreme example of a devotion to the bushiō code, a representation of the strict ideals of feudal Japan. But that feudal structure ultimately came to an end in the mid-19th century, when Japan signed numerous commercial agreements with Western countries. It was a controversial decision, but it also empowered those in Japan who opposed the power of the shogunate and wanted to restore the power of the emperor. Eventually, the combined efforts of the Choshu and Satsuma clans toppled the Tokugawa Shogunate and brought about the Meiji restoration in 1868.</p><h2>Seppuku In Post-Feudal Japan</h2><p>Three years later, feudalism in Japan officially came to an end — and with it, the reign of the samurai. That said, <a href=# rel=noopener>bushidō</a> did not disappear entirely. It became the ruling moral code of Japan, which is why, during World War II, Japanese soldiers equipped themselves with samurai swords to make suicidal "banzai" attacks.</p><p>In fact, <a href=# rel=noopener>TIME,</a> in July 1945, shared the account of a soldier who witnessed the deaths of Japanese generals Mitsuru Ushijima and Isamu Cho — brutal deaths that harkened back to the age of the samurai:</p><p>"Ushijima's aide stepped forward, bowed, handed each General a gleaming knife. The knives had been half covered with white cloth, so that the aide did not touch the sacred metal.</p><p>The Generals opened their blouses, unbuckled their belts. Ushijima leaned forward and with both hands pressed the blade against his belly. One of his adjutants did not wait for the knife to plunge deep. With his razor-sharp saber he lopped off his superior's head. General Cho leaned forward against his blade. The adjutant swung again. Orderlies took the bodies away.</p><p>General Cho had left his own epitaph: 'Twenty-second day, sixth month, 20th year of Showa era. I depart without regret, fear, shame or obligation. Age on departure 51 years.'"</p><p>Although the men had not been samurai, they still sought an honorable death through seppuku. While the act is unlikely to be used in the modern age, the fact that it lasted well into the 20th century is, if nothing else, remarkable. Seppuku, though it might seem gruesome to Westerners, represented the deeply ingrained cultural ideals of feudal Japan that altered the course of the nation's history.</p><p>After learning about seppuku, check out more of <a href=#>Japan's Imperial era</a> and be sure and dive deeper into the <a href=#>lost ways of the last samurai</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiZnKHBqa3TrKCnrJWnsrTAyKeeZ5ufony0sc%2BprKSt</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
