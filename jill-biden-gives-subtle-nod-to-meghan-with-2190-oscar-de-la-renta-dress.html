We’ve seen how the First Lady can get it wrong – remember Melania and her ‘I really don’t care’ Zara shacket? But so far, Jill hasn’t put a well-heeled foot wrong with her sartorial statements.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘She set out her stall early with her pro-Suffrage choice of purple at her husband’s inauguration and her decision to go ‘matchy matchy’ on International Women’s Day with that beautiful Oscar de la Renta citrus print gown from the same collection Meghan Markle is a pretty interesting coincidence.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Meghan and Harry’s interview with Oprah has absolutely divided public opinion, but with that dress, especially on a day that celebrates women, I would love to think Jill is quietly sending a positive message of support from one strong woman, wife and mother to another. And she is looking absolutely fabulous with it.’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>According to UK-based marketplace Love The Sales, searches for ‘lemon printed dresses’ increased in popularity since March, compared with the same time last year.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Co-founder Stuart McClure said: ‘The new First Lady’s choice of dress was certainly a statement and not just for the eye-catching lemon-printed pattern from Oscar de la Renta’s pre-spring collection.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘It was the same, exact style as Meghan wore last month at a virtual Spotify event – since Meghan’s appearance we’ve seen an 81 per cent increase in demand for ‘lemon print’ dresses with many less expensive styles from Missguided and Asos close to selling out! Meghan really still has the ability to inspire the fashion appetite of the public’&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Among the women Jill honoured earlier this week is Iranian chess arbitrator Shohreh Bayat, an imprisoned women’s right leader in Belarus and Sister Alicia Vacas Moro, a registered nurse who established clinics to help impoverished women and children.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>She said:&nbsp;‘Some of these women have spent their lives fighting for their cause. Others are just starting out on a journey they didn’t ask for.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘Some were called to service, and some couldn’t escape it.
