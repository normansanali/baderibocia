Obviously, as the title suggests, the “reconnection” takes place at “the lake” in summer.</span></p><p><span>But Justin’s not only reconnection with people there. “Whether he realizes it or not, he is also reconnecting with some fundamental part of himself from when he was younger, as we do when our adult life blows up,” Jordan said. And helping him do so are an eccentric group of relatives, neighbors, and love interests who resides around the lake.</span></p><p><span>Amongst these people, there also stands a little gender-fluid child named Opal, and he’s portrayed by Declan Whaley.</span></p><p><span>Opal is Justin’s stepsister Maisy-May’s son who quickly makes friends with Justin and makes him feel like “some tired old gay.”</span></p><p><span>As per Jordan, having a dynamic young queer character on </span><i><span>The Lake </span></i><span>was a brilliant idea. “Putting someone like Opal in the same frame as someone like Justin. It’s an opportunity for the audience to learn without feeling like they’re being fed,” he said.</span></p><p><span>He’s also happy with the fact that the show embraces LGBTQ personas without forcing any moments of toxicity just for the sake of drama. “I suppose someone could watch the show and call foul and say, ‘Well, that’s not how the world really is.’ I think our response to that was always like, ‘Yeah, we know, but it’s how the world could be,’” he explained.</span></p><p><span>Furthermore, he’s sure that nobody will bat an eye about Opal’s gender nonconformity. And he thanks Declan for that. “Declan is fantastic, just a wonderful treat, and somehow understood this person in an almost otherworldly and ethereal way,” he said.</span></p><h3><b>How Much Is Declan Whaley Net Worth?</b></h3><p><span>Declan Whaley garnered a net worth of under $150 thousand by 2023.</span></p><p><span>This child actor started his career in 2015 appearing as a Doggers Batter in </span><i><span>LIP SERVICE: Proof That Baseball Is a Kid’s Game</span></i><span>.
