"If you give me one of your songs, a full song," he begins, standing up to address the room. "A full song. If I put ad-libs on the song, I'ma put ad-libs where you--you wouldn't know it should have been ad-libs there, but it sounds so perfect."</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Clearly, Thugger understands that his mind works in mysterious ways -- ways that just so happen to understand the science of ad-lib placement more effectively than most. To confirm that Thug isn't simply all-talk, Zoey Dollaz slid through to share some first-hand experience. "Crazy cus I got a song I was recording he walked in the studio and said let me do ur Adlibs," explains Dollaz. "Ni*ga sat down recorded himself and did the adlibs on there." It would seem that Thug not only wants to do them, but&nbsp;needs&nbsp;to. And why wouldn't he? When one has a gift, one tends to enjoy using it whenever the occasion demands it.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>&lt;b>Feature Editor&lt;/b> &lt;!--BR--> Mitch Findlay is a writer and hip-hop journalist based in Montreal.
