They share three daughters: Alexia, 27, Sophia, 24, and Portia, 16. Umansky is also stepfather of Richards’ <a href=#>daughter Farrah</a>, 35, whom she shares with ex-husband <b>Guraish Aldjufrie</b>.</p><p>In July 2023, <i>Us Weekly</i> confirmed Richards and Umansky’s separation <a href=#>after 27 years of marriage</a>.</p><p>“Kyle and Mauricio have been separated for a while, but are still currently living together,” a source told <i>Us</i> at the time, noting that the estranged spouses “are amicable while they figure out the next steps.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/Kyle-Richards-and-Mauricio-Umansky-Are-Taking-a-Break-From-Therapy.jpg><p>As rumors swirled that the pair had split because of infidelity, they issued a joint statement denying that there had been <a href=#>any “wrongdoing”</a> in their relationship.</p><p>“In regards to the news that came out about us today … Any claims regarding us divorcing are untrue. However, yes, we have had a rough year,” the twosome said in a joint statement via Instagram. “The most challenging one of our marriage. But we both love and respect each other tremendously. There has been no wrongdoing on anyone’s part. Although we are in the public eye, we ask to be able to work through our issues privately.”</p><p>Richards and Umansky appeared to indirectly address the widespread speculation regarding the nature of her friendship with country singer <b>Morgan Wade</b>.</p><p>“While it may be entertaining to speculate, please do not create false stories to fit a further salacious narrative,” their statement read. “Thank you for the love and support. Kyle & Mauricio.”</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>More than six months later, an <a href=#>insider exclusively told <i>Us</i></a><i> </i>that the reality stars were not getting any closer to making their breakup official.</p><p>“Neither of them wants to pull the trigger [and file for divorce],” the source told <i>Us </i>in February, noting that the duo’s hesitancy doesn’t have anything to do with money. “They don’t have a prenup, so Kyle will be getting half of everything, but that doesn’t bother Mauricio.”</p><p>While Richards and Umansky haven’t yet filed for divorce, the source said there likely won’t be a reconciliation. “It feels so final,” the insider told <i>Us</i>, noting that the former couple are “in an OK place” despite their separation. “They share space, and it’s working for them now.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaksZyaerO1wqGYq5yjYq6vsIymmK6qmZi2sHnUppinq5uueqK%2BxGarmqOZo7RurYybqZ6Zm2Kzs7vMZquhnaKWvbp7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
