His death is listed as “natural.” He was 76.</p><p>Weathers’ family first <a href=#>confirmed his death</a> on February 2, revealing he “died peacefully in his sleep.”</p><p>“Carl was an exceptional human being who lived an extraordinary life,” they told <a href=# rel=noopener>Deadline</a> in a statement at the time. “Through his contributions to film, television, the arts and sports, he has left an indelible mark and is recognized worldwide and across generations. He was a beloved brother, father, grandfather, partner, and friend.”</p><p>Weathers was a professional football player before transitioning to acting in the ‘70s.

I’m so so torn up I can’t even tell you,” Stallone said in a February 2 Instagram video. “Carl Weathers was such an integral part of my life, my success, everything about it. I give him incredible credit and kudos because when he walked into that room and I saw him for the first time, I saw greatness but I didn’t realize how great. I never could have accomplished what we did with Rocky without him.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/02/Sylvester-Stallone-Pays-Tribute-to-Rocky-Costar-Carl-Weathers-After-His-Death-at-76-634.jpg><p>Stallone called the late actor “brilliant” in his “voice, his size, his power, his athletic ability” but “most importantly in his heart and his soul.”</p><p>Alongside the video, Stallone captioned the post, “We lost a legend yesterday.
