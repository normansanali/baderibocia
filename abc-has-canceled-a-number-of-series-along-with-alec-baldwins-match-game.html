The current season, hosted by Alec Baldwin, is coming to an end due to cancellation.</p><h2>What was the reason for the cancellation of Alec Baldwin’s Match Game?</h2><p>Along with Match Game, presented by Alec Baldwin, ABC has canceled a number of series. Rumors circulated that the cancellation was related to Baldwin’s sad incident on the set of Rust, in which he inadvertently shot and murdered cameraman Halyna Hutchins.&nbsp;However, ABC’s decision to terminate the program was unrelated to the occurrence since Match Game had not been in production since 2020, prior to the COVID-19 epidemic, and only broadcast the last two episodes in 2021.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Alec-Baldwin-2.jpg alt="Alec Baldwin" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><p>Several more programs were canceled.&nbsp;Card Sharks, Celebrity Dating Game, The Hustler, Celebrity Family Feud, and The Ultimate Surfer were also canceled by ABC. Card Sharks, presented by Joel McHale, aired for two seasons and featured participants competing for cash prizes by betting on cards before they were turned over. It was a re-enactment of the 1980s game show.</p><p>The Celebrity Dating Game, presented by Zooey Deschanel and Michael Bolton, premiered in 2021. It introduced celebrities to the Dating Game formula, with them quizzing prospective suitors in an attempt to determine the celebrity behind the wall. Bolton also performed song interpretations as hints for the participants in the program. The Hustler billed as “the most devious game on television” gathered people to answer questions and place money in a pot. The storyline twist of the program is that one of the players is a mole who knows the answers and is attempting to conceal their identity in order to earn the reward. The program, which is based on a British pattern, will run for two seasons beginning in 2021. Some series, such as Celebrity Family Feud, Press Your Luck, and The $100,000 Pyramid, were renewed for another season.</p><p><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Alec-Baldwin-3.jpg alt="Alec Baldwin" width=400 height=400 sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></p><h2>Regarding Alec Baldwin’s Match Game</h2><p>Alec Baldwin’s Match Game is based on the original ’70s hit and has competitors filling in blanks in sentences while attempting to match the answers with a panel of celebrity guests. Baldwin has co-hosted the show with a rotating panel of celebrities, including Niecy Nash, Jack McBrayer, and Cheryl Hines. The program premiered in 2016 and lasted five seasons. The most current season of the program, which aired before the pandemic, consisted of nine episodes, with the last ones showing in July 2021. Scott St. John, the show’s creator, served as executive producer.</p><h2 class=screen-reader-text>Post navigation</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiamaS0s63PobCgoaOpe6S7zGiYm5tdna60ecKapZydnJqxbq2Mp6ymmpWnerCyjKycq6GVqHqiuM6nnmavmam1bq3LnppmmpGhsbi1zaxkppmkmLVus8CmnGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
