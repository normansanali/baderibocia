Based on the image shared on social media, not only did she wear a wig similar to the Cyberpunk character, but she also wore a two-piece outfit that was very revealing. Although she had a somewhat modified version of Rebeccaâ€™s black jacket on, it still wasnâ€™t enough to cover up the rest of her body.</p><p data-characters=300 data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false>Itâ€™s no secret that different airports and airlines have varying dress codes. Most of the time, all they ask is for travelers to wear closed shoes and something simple and casual. In 2017, Delta stated that swimwear, sleepwear, or exposed underwear is not allowed to be worn during its flights.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter" data-current-count=600 data-injectable=true><p lang=en dir=ltr>We don't have an item-specific clothing policy, but we encourage no swimwear, sleepwear or underwear as your outerwear. ðŸ˜ƒ *MC</p>â€” Delta (@Delta) <a href=#>March 27, 2017</a></figure><p data-characters=515 data-current-count=515 data-injectable=false>While the situation was unfortunate for Kine-Chan, she probably should have seen something like this coming. It was already obvious that her attire would raise some alarm bells, but she took the gamble, only for it not to go her way. Her experience ultimately serves as a cautionary tale; donâ€™t be late to the airport, let alone an event. Better yet, bring an extra set of clothes, just in case. And if you do plan to cosplay in public, just make sure that what your wearing fits the venueâ€™s dress code.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivlZy8tcDHoqqcp6aav6awjZympmejpLCqrctmpJ6cmZZ8sLrLsp2apqNisLOxwK2mq2WXmsG0ecGapaedlGKzs7vMZpiiqqCkv7V5wJ%2BrnqpdqLWww8innmatoGK2r3nCspmeqqCqu6x5xJ2enqqlo7umvtJmmqiroKGuuns%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
