She was born in Roztoka, Poland then Rohnstock in Lower Silesia. A Lutheran preacher gave birth to Siegemund.</p><p>She wed Christian Siegemund, an accountant when she was only 19 years old. Siegemund opted to study obstetrics after having to deal with inept midwives during her own pregnancy.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Justine-Siegemund.jpg><p><strong>On December 26, 1636, Justine Dietrich entered the world.</strong> She was a Silesian midwife and the daughter of a Lutheran preacher in the town of Rohnstock (now Roztoka, Poland). In 1650, when she was just 14 years old, her father passed away.</p><p>She authored the first German medical literature, “The Court Midwife” in 1690 which focused on obstetrics. She wed Christian Siegemund, an accountant in 1655. In their 42 years of marriage, they never had children but were always there for each other professionally.</p><p><strong>If you’re interested in reading more about the death of Justine Siegemund, you may find that information in the post given below:</strong></p><h2><strong>How did Justine Siegemund Make History?</strong></h2><p>On March 28 in 1690, the foundational literature “The Court Midwife” by Justine Siegemund was released. Medical textbook status was confirmed by European University Viadrina Frankfurt (Oder). Given that this medical knowledge had traditionally been passed down orally.</p><p>This literature helped standardize the approach to safe birth practices. <span>When The Court Midwife was released in Germany, it was the first book of its kind.</span></p><p>This came out at a period when women’s access to higher education was severely limited. Siegemund was the first German-speaking woman to write a major medical text. She also broke ground by penning the first German book written from a female obstetrician’s point of view.</p><p><strong>Last week, Google Doodle honored Marcel Marceau and in our post given below, we covered some additional details about him:</strong></p><h2><strong>Justine Siegemund: An Inspiring Tale of Strength and Perseverance</strong></h2><p><strong>Justine at age 20 was misdiagnosed with a prolapsed uterus</strong>. After seeing the agony of birth with a misplaced fetal arm, she was inspired to study obstetrics and open her own clinic the following year. She helped underprivileged women in her community through their pregnancies and childbirth for free until 1670.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/venturejolt.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/03/Justine-Siegemund-Born-1-1.jpg><p>Her list of paying customers expanded to include wealthy merchants and aristocrats. Siegemund became Legnica’s official city midwife in the year 1670. Siegemund’s reputation as a skilled midwife grew to the point where male physicians sought her help when a cervical tumor threatened Luise, Duchess of Legnica; she successfully removed the tumor.</p><p>In the same year, her former boss, Martin Kerger claimed that she had engaged in risky childbirth techniques. Kerger’s medical school classmates in Frankfurt a der Oder sided with Siegemund and Kerger’s own words proved that he lacked her professional expertise in the areas of women’s reproductive and newborn anatomies and birthing.</p><p>Siegemund’s professional prospects did not change as a result of the charges. In 1683, Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg saw enough in her to appoint her as his court midwife in Berlin.</p><p>In 1696, she helped the Saxon Electress Eberhardine give birth to Frederick Augustus II at the court of Augustus the Strong. She was also helping out at other births in the Berlin region at the same time. According to the Berlin deacon who officiated Siegemund’s funeral on November 10, 1705,<strong> she had given birth to about 6,200 babies by the time she passed away.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>You may read all of our most recent posts about the lives and careers of other historical figures by adding our site <a href=# rel=noopener>venturejolt.com</a> to your bookmarks.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiulaPBtr7Eo6alrF6YvK57kWlpbGdgaHxzhY6jrKysmaOybr%2FInp6epaWjsW6uzqulaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
