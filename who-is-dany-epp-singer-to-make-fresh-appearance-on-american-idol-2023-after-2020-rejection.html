Aspiring contestants are ready to showcase their talent in front of judges Luke Bryan, <a href=#>Katy Perry</a>, and <a href=# rel>Lionel Richie</a>. In the coming week's auditions, some exceptionally talented performers are set to captivate both the audience and the judges with their singing abilities. The audition rounds will be followed by Hollywood Week, where the judges cut down the number of contestants to the top 24. From there, the top 16 will perform on a live stage for viewer votes, and the top 10 contestants will go on tour.</p><p>In the upcoming episode of '<a href=#>American Idol'</a> 2023, <a href=#>fans and viewers</a> will witness a childhood dream come true. Rockland County resident Dany Epp of Suffern will make her debut on the beloved show in the episode airing on Sunday, March 12. She appeared for the audition back in 2020 but unfortunately, her voice did not tune in with the judges. Come 2023, she is back again, and this time she is confident to strike a chord with the judges and viewers.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>RELATED ARTICLES</strong></p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Who is We Ani?

She has been singing since she could speak and credits the success of her musical journey to her mother. Growing up, she was always around music, thanks to her mother, who also introduced her to the show. She auditioned unsuccessfully in 2020 but decided she wouldn’t give up just yet. This year, she has successfully bagged an audition with the judges, after sending out her video audition and getting selected. Epp also has a YouTube channel with almost 2K followers and a TikTok handle, where she showcases her musical abilities. This audition can only open up new doors for her.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=split>Dany Epp in 'American Idol' Season 21</h2><p>Epp's passion for music began at a young age, and she knew that singing was her true calling. She decided to sing a song that is not only close to her heart, but also meaningful. She will be singing 'The One That Got Away', which will be particularly challenging because she will sing it before the song's original singer, Katy Perry. But that did not break her confidence, just like her 2020 auditions did not. She wishes to embrace the new possibilities singing has in store for her and someday she hopes she can make a living out of it.&nbsp;</p><p>'American Idol' 2023 Season 21 airs every Sunday on ABC at 8 pm ET.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmillZbEuHrCqKRor5ikeqq%2FjJ2Yp7Fdmr2xedKipaCdomLBsHnMmqKeZZansrS0jJqnqZ2Rp66vr8RmpqdlkaKys7XCmqVmoZSkuW5%2Bj2tqZpmWqbKzeZFpaWllopq3pq%2FToqan</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
