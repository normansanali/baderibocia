The Jane’s Addiction guitarist is well known for his ability to use an instrument of his choice, and he has collaborated with other famous musicians on projects. However, it seems that in addition to music, he also wants to spice up his love life. While the guitarist is famous for his contributions to the guitar world, his bad-boy behavior seems to thrive in the heart of the news. His many girlfriends, three wives and three divorces made great news.</p><p>He has a history of changing interests in love and has been married three times, despite the fact that his followers have been hoping he finds a long term relationship with the perfect person. His longest relationship was with Carmen Electra.</p><h2 id=ftoc-heading-1 class=ftwp-heading>Dave Navarro’s girlfriend</h2><p>Dave Navarro was last spotted with his then-girlfriend Andrea Tantaros, a political analyst and Fox pundit. They first met in 2015, when one of their acquaintances introduced them. Navarro, a former Red Hot Chili Peppers guitarist, has many connections.</p><p><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Dave-Navarro-2.jpg" alt="Dave Navarro" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Among his girlfriends are Jayme Langford, Jenny Spain, Brooke Haven, Izabella Miko, Daisy De La Hoya, Sasha Gray, Margaret Cho, Stormy Daniels, Kelly Carlson, Tammy Donaldson, Jasmine Lennard (formerly dated Simon Cowell ), Taylor Wayne, Jenna Jameson, Kendra Jade, Jessica Jaymes, Jenna Presley, Carmen Electra and Courtney Love. While dating Tantaros, Navarro was also caught flirting with a mysterious brunette, who many assumed was his new lover.</p><h2 id=ftoc-heading-2 class=ftwp-heading>Dave Navarro is now married?</h2><p>Navarro, host and judge of Ink Master, married Tania Goddard, a famous makeup artist, in 1990. However, Navarro and his first wife called off the wedding after three years. He married his second wife, Rhian Gittins, in 1994, shortly after his first divorce. This love affair lasted for about a month, then the couple requested an annulment.</p><a href=# rel=dofollow class=ua886a6b448315d9c27e1f2cf992408fd><span class=ctaText>See also</span>&nbsp; <span class=postTitle>Big Brother 25: How Bowie Jane's HOH Reign Could Change The Game (Who Could She Nominate?)</span></a><p>Baywatch breakout star Carmen Electra married Navarro in 2003. Fans expected the marriage to last longer than previous marriages, but that didn’t happen. Electra was previously married to Dennis Rodman, a former NBA star, before marrying Navarro. Navarro and Electra also appeared on the MTV reality show, Till Death, which followed their wedding preparations from the bachelorette party to the ceremonies. Electra seemed to be Navarro’s ideal wife until their marriage broke up in 2006, after two and a half years of marriage. Their demanding activities were the cause of their divorce.</p><p><img decoding=async src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/external-content.duckduckgo.com/iu/?u=biographygist.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/04/Dave-Navarro-3.jpg" alt="Dave Navarro" sizes="(max-width: 400px) 100vw, 400px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p>Navarro and Electra are no longer married but they still keep in touch. On Navarro’s 51st birthday, the Scary movie actress posted a photo of herself and Navarro at her wedding, with the caption, “My love for him is forever.” In 2014, a picture of them together sparked speculation that the two had reunited, although Navarro denied it, saying they were good friends and nothing happened.</p><h2 id=ftoc-heading-3 class="ftwp-heading screen-reader-text">redirect post</h2><p>previous article</p><p>Who is Daniel A Jost?
