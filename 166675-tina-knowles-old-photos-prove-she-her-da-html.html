Unfortunately, she had to go back to Texas only one year after landing her spot in the business due to her parents’ health problems.</p><p class=Fg>Her experience in Shiseido was enough for her to open a 12-seat hair salon in Houston called Headliners. Since it became one of the most popular hair businesses in Houston, it helped her family to afford an upper-class lifestyle.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.amomama.com/38ff7845e2ff55810bb2e323993ddb8f2063851565713594.jpg><p class=Vi data-testid=image-source>Tina Knowles and Solange at EMM Group's THE Estate on July 18, 2008 in Bridgehampton, New York | Source: Getty Images</p><p><h3 class=Kg><strong class=Dg>USING BEYONCÉ’S MOMENTUM</strong></h3></p><p class=Fg>Tina Lawson rose to fame thanks to Destiny’s Child, the girl group which best-known line-up was formed by Beyoncé, Kelly Rowland, and Michelle Williams.
