The 33-year-old was&nbsp;<a href=# rel class="font-semibold hover:text-accent-color border-b-2 border-accent-color">found dead in her Richmond, Texas apartment</a> over the weekend, along with the man who killed her.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“She’s a person, that was our baby,” Gagnier’s mother, Jeaneta told Eyewitness News. “She was so famous in her world, and so loved in ours.”</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">The model, who had just under three million followers on Instagram, was found strangled to death. Alongside Gagnier’s body, was a man later identified as 34-year-old Kevin Alexander Accorto. Authorities do not currently believe that the two had any sort of relationship, but Gagnier’s sister, London, alleged in an Instagram post that Accorto had been stalking Jenae.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“N*ggas don’t know shit. She wasn’t robbed. It was just a stalker from outta state who’d BEEN stalking her. Don’t play on my baby’s name EVER,” she wrote.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">It was Gagnier’s father, Mark, who discovered her body on Sunday evening after the family hadn’t heard from her all weekend. “I know my daughter and when I got to my daughter's house and it was locked up and she's not answering my phone call, which is not like her, I knew something was up,” he recounted to Eyewitness News.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“I didn’t hesitate to kick the door down. What I saw, I wouldn’t want any parent to go through.” Mark discovered Jenae’s lifeless body at the bottom of the staircase, initially thinking her death may have been an accident.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">Upon arriving upstairs, Gagnier discovered Accorto’s body with a knife in his neck; investigators say that the 34-year-old stubbed himself after strangling the Instagram model.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“He was twitching, he was gurgling,” recalled the star’s father. “I could look in the room and there’s writings all over the wall.” The notes, written in lipstick and pen, contained chilling confessions, apologies, and professions of love for Jenae.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">“I don’t know how he found her and I don’t know how all this happened,” Mark continued. He also added that he and his daughter regularly discussed the potential of her internet fame warranting some obsessed fans. “It scared the hell out of me,” he said.</p><p class="__className_619da4 text-dark-grey !leading-[1.9125rem] break-words text-[17px] lg:text-lg">ABC 13 reports that Gagnier’s cause of death has been ruled homicide; the autopsy shows evidence of strangulation and a traumatic concussion. Richmond investigators are still working to find out how Accorto could’ve gotten into his victim’s apartment.</p><p>About The Author</p><p>Hayley Hynes is the former Weekend Managing Editor of HotNewHipHop, she stepped down after two years in 2024 to pursue other creative opportunities but remains on staff part-time to cover music, gossip, and pop culture news.
