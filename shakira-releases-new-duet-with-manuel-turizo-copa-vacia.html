Although few details surrounding the split were released to the public at the time, it was later revealed that Gerard allegedly cheated on Shakira.&nbsp;</p><p data-characters=302 data-current-count=700 data-injectable=true>What makes matters even worse is that the alleged infidelity occurred when the “Waka Waka” singer’s father was hospitalized after suffering a bad fall. Since then, Shakira’s father has recovered from his injuries, and she and her sons have started a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">new life in Miami, Florida.</a></p><p data-characters=355 data-current-count=355 data-injectable=false>During an interview with&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">People en Español</a>&nbsp;on June 26, the “Hips Don’t Lie” vocalist shared how she found out about Gerard’s alleged infidelity.&nbsp;Shakira told the publication that she found about the cheating allegations from the press after her father, who came into town to console her following her breakup, was hospitalized:</p><p>“He went to Barcelona to console me after I was consumed with sadness because of my separation. While he was at Milan’s first communion, he was gravely injured in an accident. Everything happened at once. My home was falling apart. I was finding out through the press that I had been betrayed while my dad was in the ICU.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-11 data-characters=428 data-current-count=428 data-injectable=true>Also, in the discussion, Shakira shared that she was excited to release new music highlighting the emotions she felt following the betrayal and where she is currently in her life. The “La Tortura” songstress didn’t disappoint because mere days after the interview was published, Shakira uploaded visuals to her new song “Copa Vacía,” which means empty cup in English, with Manuel Turizo on TikTok.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok" data-current-count=300 data-injectable=false><a title=@shakira href=#>@shakira</a><p>COPA VACÍA 🧜‍♀️ @Manuel Turizo JUNIO 29 8:00pm EST <a title=copavacia href=#>#CopaVacia</a> <a title=newmusic href=#>#newmusic</a></p><a title="♬ Copa Vacía - Shakira & Manuel Turizo" href=#>♬ Copa Vacía – Shakira & Manuel Turizo</a></figure><p data-characters=492 data-current-count=792 data-injectable=true>In the teaser, Turizo is seen carrying Shakira (who is dressed in a mermaid costume) out of the water as various clips of the music video appear on the screen.
